Where water is scarce or labourunskilIed, the 'dry' process is applied; such is the case in Brazl and Ethiopia, themain producers of 'natural' unwashed arabicas and most robustas. Where allcherries can be picked at the optimal degree of ripeness, where water is abundantand equipment is available, coffee is treated by the 'wet process, resulting in'washed' arabicas. The two processes are shown schematically in Table 2.ln the 'dry' or 'natural' procss, cherries of different degrees of ripeness arestrip-picked and handled simultaneously. They are spread in a thin layer on theground, where they are sun-dried for up to three weeks. Husks (skin and pulp) areremoved in centrifugaI hullng machines.ln the 'wet or 'washed' process, freshly picked berries are separated in waterchannels into 'floaters' (overripe and one-bean cherries) and 'sinkers' (ripecherries), which are pulped mechanically; floaters are usually dry-processed andconsumed locally. Enzymatic fermentation of the mucilage which stil adheres tathe bean solubilzes the mass so that it can be removed by stirring with water.

Formerly trichloro-ethylene (see IAC, 1979, 1987) was used.(ii) Bean decaffeinationThis technique was patented in 1905 by Roselius (Meyer, 1906; Meyer et aL.,1908; Katz, 1987) and is stil the most commonly used.

Most countries requirethat the content be reduced to less th an 0.1% on a dry weight basis. The beans arethen freed from residual volatile solvent (deodorized) by steam stripping atlOO-110°C for 1-4 h to levels usuallywell below those required by local regulations(..5-15 ppm according to country and solvent), and dried to their initial moisturecontent (approximately 10%) at 40-48 ° C for 0.5-10 h wi th hot air or under vacuum.The solvent is recovered by batch or continuous evaporation or by steamstripping of the caffeine under vacuum, and the caffeine is purified by repeatedcrystallzation for further use in, e.g., cola-type drinks.Green coffee beans can also be decaffeinated using supercritical carbondioxide at temperatures and pressures above its critical point (31.06°C, 73.8 bar),usually at 4O-8O°C and 20-300 bar for 5-30 h (Zosel, 1981; Martin, 1982).Supercritical carbon dioxide is circulated in a pressurized vessel through moistcoffee, where it dissolves the caffeine selectively; the caffeine solution is then passedthrough a second pressurized vessel containing activated carbon or water whichretains the caffeine.(iii) Extract decaffeinatìonGreen (or roasted) coffee beans are extracted with water (Berry & Walters,1943), and the extract is decaffeinated either by liquid-liquid extraction withdichloromethane (Katz, 1980) followed by steam deodorization or by selectiveadsorption of caffeine on acid-activated carbon. Processes that do not employ anorganic solvent are known as 'water decaffeination'.The decaffeinated extract is concentrated and reincorporated on the predrieddecaffeinated beans (Fischer & Kummer, 1979; Green & Blanc, 1981).Alternatively, the decaffeinated extract can be used to decaffeinate new beans (Katz& Proscia, 1981). The beans are then dried to their initial moisture leveL.(c) Roasted coffee (Rothfos, 1986)(i) ProcessDuring the roasting process, hard green coffee beans which are stone-hardincrease in volume and develop a brittle structure, a dark-brown colour and acharacteristic flavour rich in volatile constituents.

The release of carbon dioxide and volatile aroma increases attemperatures above 150°C. ln the last phase of roasting, when the temperaturereaches approximately 190°C, the reaction becomes exothermic and the beans puff,doubling in size.The chemical constituents of green beans can change dramatically withroasting. For example, the total chlorogenic acid content of green arabica coffeebeans is typically 6.9%; following light roasting, the concentration decreases toabout 2.7%, and after dark roasting is only about 0.2% (Trugo & Macrae, 1984a).Mter coling, which can be acclerated by quenching with water, residualcarbon dioxide trapped in the bean is released slowly over a period of days.The main operations used in the manufacture of roasted coffee are shown inTable 3.Table 3.

Modem gas-heated roasters are equipped with gas recirculation units andcatalysts to reduce emissions. Some models are also equipped with automaticcleaning cycles to avoid a build-up of tars (Viani, 1986).ln sorne of the more recent models, so-called 'high yield or 'fast roasted' coffeecan be prepared by heating green coffee beans by convection to temperatures of upto 30°C for 2-3 min and by increasing the ratio of hot air to beans. This type ofroasted coffee can yield up to 20% more extractable matter with a sharper tastewhen brewed.(ii) GrindersRoasted beans are ground in mils that vary in capacity from a few grams to 4tonnes/ho The average particle size of the ground coffee depends on the extractionequipment to be used; indicative sizes are given in Table 4.Table 4.

Whole beans are thereforeeither placed in non-airtight packs or allowed to degas and then packed un dervacuum or in an inert atmosphere in metal cans or impermeable plastic containers.Coffee is now sold pre-ground and packed in brick packs or cans after shortdegassing (2-4 h) or under an initial slight vacuum in flexible bags with a one-waydegassing valve (Viani, 1986).\",\n",

The unit operations performed during the manufacture of instantcoffee are: storing, blending, decaffeination and roasting of green beans; grinding,recovery of volatile aroma and extraction of roasted beans; stripping of aroma;concentrating and drying of the extract; and agglomeration, aromatization andpackaging of the powder. The operations performed on the beans up to andincluding roasting have already been described. The steps described below arespecific to instant coffee technology.(i) ExtractionWhole roasted coffee beans or coffee ground to a particle size of 1.5 mm areextracted with softened water in a battery of five to eight percolation columns called'cells', with a capacity of a few kilograms to one tonne. The process issemi-continuous; water at 160-180°C enters the most completely extracted cell andcirculates through to the most recently filled cell (see Figure 1). The cells are dividedinto 'hot' cells at a temperature of 140-180°C under a pressure of 14-16 bar and'cold cells at a temperature of approximately 100°C. ln the hot cells, high-molecular-weight material (in particular carbohydrates) is extracted. ln the coldcells, the material with the most flavour is extracted. The extract is withdrawn fromthe fresh cell, cooled to 4-5°C and sent into a scale in amounts that depend on thedesired yield (33-55% based on roasted coffee) and on the concentration of theextract (10-30%). At the end of the 'draw-off' period, a new cell enters the circuit,which may have been steam-stripped to recover volatile aroma, and the spentgrounds are evacuated from the most completely extracted cel!.(ii) ConcentrationExracts with a concentration of 25-30% (w/w) soluble solids can be drieddirectly but with loss of volatile components. The volatile constituents present inextracts coming from the hot section are, however, unimportant from the point ofview of aroma or flavour. The hot extract can then be evaporated to a concentrationof 50-60% (w/w) and mixed with cold extract; if both hot and cold extracts arecollected together, the dilute extract is stripped prior to concentration and thevolatile components added back ('standardization') before drying. A techniquethat preserves most of the volatile aroma is freeze concentration, in which pure ice is\",\n",

Brewingtechniques encompass a wide range of procedures used in different parts of theworld, which are based on the types of coffee and roasting procedures traditionallyused. Loal cultural practices associated with the preparation and use of coffeeresult in a wide range of individual consumption patterns.(i) Decoction/boilingTo prepare northern Scandinavian 'boiled' coffee, roasted ground arabicacoffee is brewed in continuously boilng water. The brew is made by boilng about70 g coffee grounds in 1 1 boiling water for 10-30 min (1 cup ,. 150 ml). Thedecoction usually lasts upwards of 10 min. Sometimes, fresh coffee and water areadded to a boiling kettle during the day.Very finely ground Turkish coffee (less than 0.1 mm particle size) is brewed bygentle boilng of proportions of 5 g coffee grounds, 10 g sugar, 60 ml water untIl afoam is formed (1 cup,. 60 ml).(ii) InfuionLight-to-medium roasted, coarsely ground coffee (particle size, 0.7-1.0 mm) Isinfused with boiling water in a pot for a few minutes, stirred and separated froID thegrounds by pouring through a metal strainer. ln the 'plunger' system, the metalstrainer is pushed down the coffee pot to separate the grounds from the coffee.

For automatic coffee makers, concentrations of 28-65 g/l areused.(iv) PercolationCoarsely ground coffee (average particle size, 0.7-1.0 mm) is extracted byrecirculating boilng water until the desired brew strength is reached. ln moremodern equipment, continuous recirculation and filtration by gravity (underpressure) improve extraction and shorten brewing time to under 2 min. The use ofpercolators has declined significantly in favour of automatic drip coffee makers.Ground coffee concentrations normally used range from 40 g/ (light roast) in NorthAmerica to 60 g/ (medium roast) in the UK(v) Vaporization under pressure (espresso)Water heated to just above boiling-point is forced by slight excess pressurethrough a bed of medium-to-dark roasted coffee ground to an average particle sizeof 0.3-0.4 mm ('moca' or 'Neapolitan' coffee machines). This method is used inmost Italian and Spanish households. ln Italian 'espresso' machines, the additionof a high-pressure pump working at 8-12 bar allows rapid extraction of groundsduring 15-35 sec at a water temperature of 92-95 0 C. For 5-8 g of roasted coffee, one25-60 ml cup is obtained with an extraction yield of coffee soluble solids from theroasted coffee of 18-26% and a soluble solids concentration in the cup of 20-60 g/lbrew; 70-85% caffeine is recovered (Petracc, 199).(vi) Instant coffeeAverage concentrations used in most countries are 1.5-2.5 g/150 ml cup,although in Latin countries, 2 g/60 ml cup are common. Consumption in the tencountries where the most instant coffee was drunk in 1987 is given in Table Il.(d) Consumption in selected countriesWorldwide consumption of green coffee (1983-87 average) can be estimated at1 milion tonnes of arabica and 20 00 tonnes of robusta in producer countries and2.9 millon tonnes of arabica and 1 millon tonnes of robusta in consumer countries,giving a total of 5.1 millon tonnes per year. Using a conversion factor of 1.19 kggreen coffee for each kilogram of roasted coffee (International Coffee Organization,1982), the total quantity of roasted coffee consumed per year is thus 4.29 milliontonnes.\",\n",

This figurecorresponds to just over half of the caffeine consumed from all sources (Roberts &Barone, 1983; Gilbert, 1984; Simpson, 1988).Data on actual coffee or caffeine consumption are often based on the reportednumber of cups per day; but the wide variabilty in volume and strength of a 'cup' ofbrewed coffee renders such data difficult to interpret. The actual variation of'cups'has been reported in sever al studies in North America. Accrding to a study inCanada (Stavric et al., 1988), one household cup equals approximately 22 ml butcan vary between 25 and 330 ml, with mean caffeine contents of 84, 71 and 82 mglcupfor drip, instant and percolated coffee, respectively. ln another study in Canada(Gilbert et al., 1976), cup size varied between 140 and 285 ml, with a caffeine contentof 29-176 mglcup for brewed and instant coffees. ln the USA, mean caffeinecontents were 115 mg (range, 60-180 mg)/150-ml cup of drip coffee, 80 mg (40-170mg) of percolated coffee and 65 mg (30-12 mg) of instant coffee (Lecos, 1984).Coffee consumption by different populations also varies widely, depending onthe type of coffee used and brewing practices. ln any single region, coffee brewsdiffer widely in terms of the concentration of soluble solids and chemicalconstitution, as in urban areas of Scandinavia where boiled, filtered and espressotypes are likely to be consumed.

AlI of these factors influence the concentration of solublesubstances in the resultant brews and their chemical compositions. GeneralIy,42,48 and 57 g roasted, ground coffee are used typically per litre of water in the USA,UK and Europe, respectively, and some 150 ml of the water are retained in the spentcoffee grounds.Soluble substances have already been extracted from instant coffee at the pointof manufacture. The percentage removed varies according to brand and may be upta 50%, sa that more of the normally insoluble substances are rendered soluble at100°C. About 12 g/l is a typically used average concentration of product in waterfor UK and US tastes; it is higher and lower in other countries. Clearly, thecomposition of different instant coffees varies considerably, especially in therelative proportions of the various constituents.The main component of the beverages consumed is therefore water. Caffeinehas particularly important stimulatory properties, but all three preparationscontain other nonvolatile soluble compounds. Compounds of known physiologicalimportance in roasted coffee and instant coffee have been reviewed by Viani (1988).Volatile compounds occur in the dry product, and their presence in the brews isagain dependent on the amount and type of product and on the brewing conditions:40-100% is extracted in practice (Pictet, 1987). The content of volatile substances ininstant coffees is particularly dependent upon the sophistication of the method forextracting and retaining such substances on drying. The influence of nonvolatile',\n",
       " \"COFFE65and volatile components on the flavour of coffee has been described in detail(Clarke, 1986).Tables 15 and 16 give a broad tabulation of all components of green androasted arabica and robusta coffees (Clarke, 1987). It should be noted thatconsiderable variation mayocur, depending on factors such as the exact sourceand storage conditions, especially with regard to the concentrations of compoundsthat occur at low levels, such as aliphatic acids, reducing sugars and free aminoacids. The values for polysaccharides, lignin and pectin are considered to be lessreliable than others, as they are derived by indirect analysis from data on hydrolysis;however, theyare indicative. For roasted coffee, further differences depend on thedegree of roasting. Roasted coffee may also contain roasted seeds, tubers and otherparts of vegetable plants, such as chicory. Instant coffee may similarly contain thesoluble parts of these materials (Clarke & Macrae, 1987a).Table IS.

Tacalculate representative values for the content in the beverage consumed, anaverage usage of 10 g roasted coffee per cup of filtered coffee (150 ml), equivalent ta57 g roasted coffee brewed with Il of water, can be assumed. Approximately 86% ofthe water is in the brew and the remainder left with the grounds. At an extraction',\n",

Assuming 100% extraction of particulate substances, their content in acup can be estimated by dividing the content in roasted coffee (mg/kg) by 100.With some filter devices and using finér grinds (as in the UK), smallerquantities of roasted coffee are used, e.g., 48 g/l ofwater or 8.3 g/cup. Spiler (1984b)assumed 7.5 g/150-ml cup from US experience; however, Clinton (1985) analyseddata from 30 respondents across the USA and found an average strength of 1.38 gcoffee solubles per cup, equivalent to only 6.9 g roasted, ground coffee at 20% yield.Weaker coffee was drunk in the west than in the east.Another form of expression is that 10 g per cup is equivalent to 100 cups/kgroasted, ground coffee,- 8.3 g is equivalent to 122 cups/kg and 6.9 g to 147 cups/kg.Table 16 gave an indication of the percentages of various components that areextracted. The level may be 75-100% for components such as caffeine andchlorogenic and other acids, but is rather less for volatile components.(a) Nonvolatile substances(i) Caffeine and other purinesExtensive determinations of caffeine in green coffees have been reported(Macrae, 1985). These indicate an average of 1.2% on a dry basis (commercialrange, 0.9-1.4%) for arabica coffee and 2.2% (commercial range, 1.5-2.6%) forrobusta coffee. (Analytical methods are reported in the monograph on caffeine.)The content in roasted coffee is usually somewhat higher th an in the correspondinggreen - by up to 10% in darker roasts - due to physical loss in weightof othercomponents; 0-5% of the caffeine is lost by sublimation. Few reliable directdeterminations have been made on roasted coffee, but several have been done onbrewed coffee (Table 17; Bunker & McWillams, 1979; Clinton, 1985). Minuteamounts of related alkaloids have been identified and quantified in roasted coffee,e.g., theobromine at 0.00-0.037% and theophyllne at 0.00-0.013% (Kazi, 1985;Macrae, 1985); traces of paraxanthine, theacrine and liberine have been detected inunripe green coffees (Viani, 1988).(ii) Chlorogenic acids and related substancesA number of different chlorogenic acids are present; the amount of eachdepends largely on the degree and type of roasting to which the green coffee hasbeen subjected (Clifford, 1985). 5-Caffeoylquinic acid is present in the largestamounts, in both green and roasted coffees. Dicaffeoyl and feruloyl quinic acids arealso present, together with the 3- and 4-isomers of monocaffeoylquinic acid. Thetotal percentage of chlorogenic acids in eight commercial roasted coffee samplesranged from 0.2-3.5% (very dark to light roasting) (Trugo, 1984), and that in 19samples was 1.6-3.8% (Maier, 1987a). On the basis of 10 g coffee per cup of brew',\n",
       " '68IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51and 85% recovery, this would indicate a level of 15-325 mg/cup (Viani, 1988). Actualdata (Clinton, 1985) from the USA give an average value of 190 mg total chlorogenicacids per cup ofbrewed coffee. Pyrolysis products of chlorogenic acid, in particularquinic acid and caffeic acid (see p. 69), are also found, depending upon the originand degree of roasting, as are phenols (see p. 76).Table 17.

The content of atractyligenin has been estimated at 2.9-1I.5mg/cup of brewed arabica and 0-0.2 mg/cup of brewed robusta (Viani, 1988).(iv) LipidsRoasted coffee has a very high lipid content - approximately 16% w/w inarabica and 11% in robusta - associated with two diterpenes specific ta coffee,',\n",
       " \"COFFEE69kahweol and cafestol, mostly combined as glycerides. The total diterpene content istypically reported at 1.3% in green arabica (ratio of cafestol:kahweol, 40:60 to 70:30)and at only 0.2% in green robusta (predominately cafestol) (Viani, 1988).There appears to be little destruction on roasting; but of greater importance isthe fact that little of the oil (1ipids) and of these terpenes occurs in brewed coffee,e.g., 0.9 mg lipid (coffee oil) per cup and 0.005 mg diterpenes in filter brews, withrather more in espresso brews (40 and 3.2 mg, respectively) (Viani, 1988).Various sterols (and theiî esters with fatty acids) and tocopherols are alsopresent in the lipids, but there is no evidence of their presence in brewed coffee. Thepresence of various alkanoylated 5-hydroxyryptamines (high Co fatty acids plus5-hydroxyryptamine) in the wax on the outer surface of green coffee beans has beenexamined extensively by Folstar (1985); they are present at 500- 1000 ppm (mg/kg),but they are partly destroyed on roasting and very little passes into the brew (van derStegen, 1979).(v) Trigonelline and nicotinic addTrigonellne is present typically at 1.1% in dry arabica green canee (range,0.6-1.3) and 0.65% in dry robusta green coffee (range, 0.3-0.9) (Macrae, 1985). Theamount destroyed during roasting depends on the degree of roast, e.g., an original1. 1 % level wil decline ta around 0.2% in dark roasts (Trugo, 1984), corresponding ta110 and 20 mg/cup assuming 10 g of roasted coffed per cup. An average content of53 mg/cup has been reported by Clinton (1985) in the USA. Trigonelline istransformed into several volatile products but aIs a into nicotinic acid (niacin;vitamin PP), ofwhich roasted and brewed coffee can be important sources (100-400mg/kg) (Macrae, 1985). A content of 0.03-0.05 mg nicotinic acid per cup wasreported from six samples (Viani, 1988); Macrae (1985) reported 1 mg/cup and2-3 mg from a dark roast. Residual trigonellne has been reported at a level of40-55 mg/cup (Viani, 1988).(vi) AddsThe nature and amount of nonvolatile acids in roasted coffee has beenexamined extensively, since they can contribute significantly to its flavour(Woodman, 1985; Maier, 1987a; van der Stegen & van Duijn, 1987). Apart fromresidual chlorogenic acids, the main acids present in significant quantities arequinic, malic, citric, lactic, pyruvic, succinic and glycolic acids (Table 18).The amount of each acid is strongly dependent upon the degree of roasting,sometimes peaking in medium roasts, such as citric acid in Kenya arabica with'fine' acidity (van der Stegen & Duijn, 1987).\",\n",

Maier(1987a) quantified these as citraconic at 0.048-0.070%, 2-furoic at 0.00-0.0250%,itaconic at 0.013-0.020%, pyrrolidone carboxylic (pyroglutamic acid) at 0.06-0.10%,mesaconic at 0.005-0.013%, fumaric at 0.010-0.016% and maleic at 0.00-0.016%; anumber of others were found at even lower levels, all in commercial roasted coffees.Tressl et al. (1978a) reported 2-furoic acid at 0.008% in an arabica roasted coffee.The total content of major nonvolatile acids estimated by the Working Groupfrom the data ofvan der Stegen and van Duijn (1987) is 276 mg/cup (assuming use of10 g roasted coffee per cup ), ranging from 246 to 300; the content estimated from thedata of Maier (1987a), including phosphoric acid, averages 231 mg in arabica and224 mg in robusta. These figures are somewhat higher than the average of 178 mg,including formic/acetic acids, given by Clinton (1985) on the basis of use of 7 g/cup.Maier (1987a) regarded the combination of citric and acetic acids as the reasonfor the higher acidity of arabica than robusta coffee. Also significant for flavour isthe relatively high amount of quinic acid lactone, which, like quinic acid itself,',\n",
       " \"COFFEE71increases and decreases again with increasing severity of roasting, peaking at 0.7%on a dry basis (Clifford, 1985). Brews containing this compound and standing atelevated temperatures show increasing acidity, partIy because this lactone istransformed into more quinic acid but also because the concentrations of sorneother acids increase (van der Stegen & van Duijn, 1987).(vii) Maillard reaction products (melanoidins)Products of the Mailard reaction are important constituents of roasted coffee;in a dry medium roast, they can comprise some 15-20%, of which 20-25% are hotwater-soluble. At present, they are poorly characterized as caramelized products ofsuc rose and condensation products of polysaccharides with 'proteins' and othercompounds (Trugo, 1985).(viii) Other compoundsClinton (1985) found reducing sugars at an average content per cup of 15 mg,other carbohydrates at 205 mg and peptides/'protein' at 62 mg.(h) Volatile substancesThe volatile compounds in coffee include carbonyl compounds, alcohols,acids, esters, terpenoid compounds, nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds,hydrocarbons, heterocyclic and aromatic compounds. The quantity (apart from thevolatile aliphatic acids) obtained by distilation of roasted coffee is about 0.1% or100 mg/kg (Silwar et al., 1986a). Volatile compounds are present in smalleramounts than in most other foods, but the range of types is greater.The number of volatile components that have been identified has risen sharplyover the last 20 years (Flament, 1987). The most up-to-date, complete listing of ailidentified components is that of Maarse and Visscher (1986) - now comprisingover 700. An earlier listing by Vitzthum (1976) gave 550 volatile compounds (anEnglish version is provided by Spiler, 1984a). Listings by Silwar et al. (1986a) andFlament (1987) give numbers only for categories of compounds. The systems ofchemical grouping used differ somewhat in these lists, particularly with regard tasulfur-containing and furan-based compounds. The numbers of volatilecompounds identified in roasted coffee are listed by group in Tables 19-22.Those compounds that have been quantified have been listed by van Straten etal. (1983) and Silwar et al. (1986a,b). Only those detected by modern gaschromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry methods (i.e., published since about1970) can be regarded as reliably identified, however.

(1983) reported quantitative data on only two of the 18aldehydes. While acetaldehyde has been reported repeatedly as being present, noreliable quantitative data appear to be available. Hayashi et al. (1986) reported alevel of 3.4-4.5 ppm (mg/l) formaldehyde (see IAC, 1982, 1987) in brewed coffee.Maarse and Visscher (1986) lIsted Il benzenoid aldehydes; van Straten et al.(1983) reported quantitative data on five of them, including 3,4-dihydroxybenz-aldehyde at 8-20 ppm (mg/kg) and benzaldehyde at 1.8 ppm (mg/kg). The laterworkof Silwar et al. (1986a), which was not in this listing, generally reported lower levelsof all carbonyls quantified in a medium-roasted arabica coffee and a lower level ofbenzaldehyde, and included 2-phenylacetaldehyde (1.5-2 mglg).Other important aldehydes present are furanoid (six quantified byvan Stratenet al., 1983); in particular, furfural has been found at up to 255 ppm (mg/kg)',\n",
       " '80IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51(equivalent to 2.6 mg/cup) and 5-methylfurfural at up to 216 ppm (mg/g; Silwar,1982). However, Silwar et al. (1986a) reported much lower quantities (up to 80 and70 ppm (mglg), respectively).Maarse and Visscher (1986) list 47 aliphatic and 16 alicyclic ketones, includingdiketones, three acetophenones, two benzenoid ketones and one benzenoiddiketone. van Straten et al. (1983) reported quantitative data on 14 of these,although only 3-methylcyclopentane-l,2-dione (cyclotene) is present at significantamounts of 17-4 ppm (mglg; Tressl et al. (1978a). This compound was notreported by Silwar et al. (1986a). Diacetyl (2,3-butadione) was present at 2.7 ppm(mglg; Silwar, 1982), but Silwar et al. (1986a) reported only 0.05-0.15 ppm (mglg)diacetyl fequivalent to 0.5-15 J1g/cup). They also gave data on 10 aliphatic ketones,three benznoid aldehydes and 14 furanoid ketones.Strictly speaking, a number of other pyrrole-based carbonyls could beincluded; but these are described with nitrogen compounds, and the quantitiesinvolved are small. Isomaltol (2-acetyl-3-hydroxyuran) has been found in arabicaand robusta coffees at levels of 8 and 1.5 ppm (mg/kg), respectively (Tressl et al.,1978a ).(ii) AlcoholsMaarse and Visscher (1986) listed 18 basic aliphatic and alicyc1ic alcohols andtwo aromatic alcohols; van Straten et al. (1983) quoted quantitative amounts foronly four of them.Furfuryl alcohol (grouped by Maarse & Visscher (1986) in the furan group) isthe most prevalent volatile compound in roasted coffee (except acetic acid), withreported levels of 300 ppm (mglg) in arabica and 520 ppm (mglg) in robusta(Tressl et al., 1978a), up to 881 ppm (mg/g; van Straten et al., 1983) and 678 ppm(mg/kg; Silwar, 1982). 5-Methylfurfuryl alcohol was reported at 25 ppm (mg/kg;Silwar, 1982).

Furfuryl alcoholis regarded as detrimental to the flavour of coffee.(iii) AcidsMaarse and Visscher (1986) listed 19 volatile acids in an aliphatic series up todecanoic, one benzoic and two alicyclic. The quantitative data quoted by vanStraten et al. (1983) are derived from Kung et al. (1967), but the later data of Blanc(1977), Maier (1987a) and van der Stegen and van Duijn (1987) are more reliable(Table 26).

None of these is reported to bepresent in any substantial amount; methyl salicylate is reported at 1.4 ppm (mg/kg)and furfuryl acetate at 16.3 ppm (mg/kg; Silwar, 1982) or 3.5-5.5 ppm (mg/kg; Silwaret al., 1986a), but there are few other quantitative data. Six ethers and nine lactonesare listed by Maarse and Visscher (1986), and are reported in relatively smallamounts by Silwar et al. (1986a).(v) Nitrogen compoundsAmines and amides: Maarse and Visscher (1986) listed the presence of 12aliphatic amines; van Straten et al. (1983) reported quantitatively only ondimethylamine at 2 ppm (mg/kg) and on five' aromatIc amines. One imide,N-~-dimethylsuccinimide (Maarse & Visscher, 1986), and the secondary amine,pyrrolidine (Singer & Lijinsky, 1976), have been reported.N-N/S- and N/O-Heterocyclic compounds: This is an important group ofcompounds with regard to the flavour of roasted coffee. Maarse and Visscher(1986) listed the presence of 71 pyraznes, 12 pyridines, four quinolines, Ilquinoxalines, 26 thiazles, 24 oxazoles, 68 pyrroles and five indoles.A considerable amount of quantitative data was reported by Tressl et al. (1981)and van Straten et al. (1983) on 44 of the pyrroles and 25 of the pyrazines. The\",\n",
       " '82IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51quantities of individual pyrroles are quite low (in general c: 1 ppm), although levelsof 1.1-2.7 ppm (mg/kg) pyrrole itself and 17 ppm (mg/kg) 2-formyl-l-methylpyrrolewere reported. Sorne pyrazines occur at higher levels (104 ppm (mg/kg) methylpyrazine), but most are found at lower levels (acetyl pyrazine, 1.3 ppm (mg/kg)).Pyridine was reported ta be present at up to 49 ppm (mg/kg; van Straten et aL., 1983).Quantitative data on 18 pyrroles (including 13 carbonylic) give a total of 79 ppm(mg/kg); 2 ppm (mg/kg) were found for two indoles and 395 ppm for 28 pyrazines(Silwar, 1982). Silwar et al. (1986a) provided quantitative data on 28 pyrazines(170-218 mg/kg), two pyridines, 14 pyrroles (mainly carbonylic, 12.6-15.0 mg/kg) andtwo indoles.2-Amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo(4,5-flquinoline (MeIQ) (see IARC, 1986b) hasbeen detected in coffee beans at 16 ng/kg (hot-air-roasted), 32 ng/kg(charcoal-roasted) and 150 ng/kg (high-temperature-roasted) only after alkalinehydrolysis (Kikugawa et al., 1989; Takahashi et al., 1989).S- and O/S-Heterocyclic compounds: Maarse and Visscher (1986) reported thepresence of 28 thiophenes and two dithiolanes and provided sa me quantitativedata; none occurs in apparently significant amounts. Silwar (1982) found sixthiophenes at a total content of 8.9 ppm (mg/kg) and one dithiolane at 3.7 ppm(mg/kg). Silwar et al. (1986b) reported the total content of six thiophenes at 4.7 ppm(mg/kg) in roasted Colombian arabica and 3.2 in roasted robusta coffee.(vi) Furan-based compoundsMaarse and Visscher (1986) reported the presence of92 furan compounds anda further 18 sulfur-containing furan compounds, many of which have beenmentioned previously (as aldehydes, ketones and esters). Furfurylthiols (furfurylmercaptans) and sulfides appear ta be especially important with regard ta flavourbut are present in only small absolute quantities, e.g., furfurylthiol at 2.2 ppm(mg/kg) iD roasted robusta, at 1.1 ppm (mg/kg) in arabica (Tressl & Silwar, 1981), at1.65 ppm (mg/kg) in roasted Ivory Coast robusta and at 0.9 ppm (mg/kg) in roastedColombias (Silwar et al., 1986b). The total content of ten sulfur-containing furanswas only 2.5-6.4 ppm (mg/kg; van Straten et al., 1983). The total content of 17 furanswas 41 ppm (mg/kg), with 2-acetylfuran contributing 31.4 ppm (Silwar, 1982; vanStraten et al., 1983). Kahweofuran (2-methyl-3-oxa-8-thiabicyclo(3.3.0)-1,4-octadiene), of particular importance in flavour, has been reported at 1.75 ppm(mg/kg) in roasted Colombian arabicas, at 2.0 ppm (mg/kg) in Kenyan coffees andat 0.45 ppm (mg/kg) in roasted Ivory Coast robustas (Silwar et aL., 1986b).(vii) Other sulfur compoundsA number of other aliphatic and aromatic sulfides, including di- andtrisulfides, are especially important in the aroma of dry roasted coffee. Maarse and',\n",
       " 'COFFEE83Visscher (1986) listed 14 aliphatic and two aromatic sulfides. The quantitiesinvolved are very small; e.g., dimethyldisulfide was found at 0.01 ppm (mg/kg) inroasted Colombian arabica and at 0.1 ppm in roasted Ivory Coast robustas (Tressl& Silwar, 1981; Silwar et al., 1986b).(viii) PhenolsPhenols are another important group of flavour compounds; 39 were listed byvan Straten et al. (1983). Quantitative determinations were reported by Tressl(1977), Tressl et al. (1978a,b), van Straten et al. (1983) and Silwar et al. (1986a). Silwaret al. (1986a) reported on the contents of 13 phenols (excluding dihydroxy- andtrihydroxybenzenes) in a medium-roasted arabica. The actual quantities presentare again smalI; the differences between roasted robusta and arabica are shown inTable 27. When arabica coffee is roasted very darkly, greater quantities of sornephenols have been found, e.g., the phenol content increased from 13 to 63 ppm(mg/kg) and that of guaiacol from 2.7 ta 10.6 ppm (Tressl et al., 1978b).(ix) PyronesThree pyrones have been identified and quantified by Tressl et al. (1978a) andreported by van Straten et al. (1983; Table 28).(x) HydrocarbonsSeventy-three hydrocarbons have been identified in roasted coffee (Maarse &Visscher, 1986); II have been quantified at the parts per bilion(micrograms/kilogram) level and four at the parts per milion (miligrams/kilogram)level (van Straten et al., 1983).As both roasted and instant coffee are derived by roasting procedures (attempe ratures of the order of 210°C, with higher air tempe ratures), polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (PAR), and in particular benzo(a)pyrene, can be expectedta be present. Numerous studies have been conducted on their actual occurrence(e.g., Ruschenburg, 1985; de Kruijf et al., 1987; reviewed by Strobel, 1988a).Determinations in roasted coffee, best done by high-performance liquidchromatography (HPLC) and fluorimetric techniques, suggest a range of c( 0.1-1.2l1g/kg, with an average of 0.3 l1g1kg; however, PAR are largely removed in the spentgrounds (e.g., on filter papers), leading to contents in the brews of ~ 0.01 l1g/1(Ruschenburg, 1985) or 0.0003-0.0008 l1g/1 (de Kruijf et al., 1987). Darker roastsproduce slightly higher values. It has been shown that the chaff produced duringroasting contains much higher levels (2-23 l1g/kg) (de Kruijf et al., 1987); althoughthis material is usually discarded, it is sometimes mixed in with subsequentlyground roasted coffee. Strobel (1988a) calculated that coffee consumptioncontributes ~ 0.1% (or 0.25 l1g per year per person) of the total PAR inhaled oringested from all sources.',\n",

To obtain representative values for the content in the beverage, it isconvenient and realistic to assume use of 2 g instant coffee per 150-ml cup. With100% solubility, the content in miligrams per kilogram for a given component ofinstant coffee should be divided by 500 ta give the content in miligrams per cup.(i) Nonvo/ati/e substancesCaffeine and other purines: Caffeine levels have been determined directly in 12commercial samples using HPLC methods (Trugo et a/., 1983); the range was 28-48g/kg (which would correspond ta 56-92 mg/cup). The higher level resulted fromhigher levels of robusta in the blend. The caffeine contents of instant coffeesmanufactured in Brazil are somewhat lower: Angelucci et aL. (1973), using aspectrophotometric method on 15 arabica samples, reported levels of 1.63-3.86%,with one robusta containing 4.64%. Minute amounts of the other alkaloids thatoccur in roasted and green coffees also appear in instant coffee, at approximatelyhalf the amount.Ch/orogenic acids and re/ated substances: Trugo and Macrae (1984b)determined by HPLC the chlorogenic acid content of 13 commercial instant coffeesbought in the UK. Total chlorogenic acids ranged from 3.61 ta 10.73%; the levelswere 2.55-7.64% for total caffeoylquinic acids, 0.16-0.58% for total dicaffeoylquinicacids and 0.74-1.93% for total feruloyl quinic acids. The levels found depended onthe extraction conditions and on differences between varieties. Data from otherworkers (summarized by Clifford, 1985) showed a similar range for totalchlorogenic acids; Maier (1987a) found (2.7-8.9%) in five samples. The lower .',\n",
       " '86IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51figures resulted from use of darkly roasted coffees. The Working Group estimatedthat these values correspond to 54-215 mglcup.Glycosides: Viani (1988) estimated the content of atractyligenin at 0.8-0.9mglcup of arabica instant coffee and negligible for robusta.Lipid: Instant coffees are generally free of lipids (and therefore thediterpenes, kahweol and cafestol), but many commercial brands are plated withabout 0.3-0.5% coffee oil obtained by expression from roasted coffee or othermethods to provide headspace aroma. Viani (1988) reported 0.02% oil and 0.002%diterpenes in nonaromatized powder and 0.3% and 0.02%, respectively, inaromatized powder, corresponding to 0.4 mglcup oil and 0.00 mglcup diterpnesin nonaromatized powder and 7 mglcup oil and 0.4 mglcup diterpenes inaromatized powder. Certan commercial brands of instant coffee contain up to10% by weight of very finely ground roasted coffee; this will increase these figures by1.6% oil and 0.12% diterpenes in the powder, or 32 and 2.4 mglcup, respectively,making this brew comparable with an espresso-type brew.Trigonelline and nicotinic acid: Trigonellne has ben determined in 12 UKcommercial dry instant coffees by HPLC; an average of 1.37% (range, 0.94-1.69%)was found (Trugo et al., 1983), (corresponding to 20-35 mglcup, although the data onroasted coffee would suggest figures of 8-44 mglcup). Viani (1988) reportedtrigonellne at 5-15 mglcup in 22 samples, which were therefore probably darklyroasted. ln the same samples, nicotinic acid was found at 0.2-1.2 mglcup; the datafor roasted coffee suggest similar levels (0.4-1.6 mglcup).Acid: Of the nonvolatile acids, quinic, citric, malic and pyruvic acids areknown to be present in fairly large quantities. Blanc (1977) reported on the totalquantity of citric, malic, lactic and pyruvic acids and of the volatile acetic acid ininstant coffees from four different countries. A range of 1.5-4.9% was found, whichsuggests that the acid content is increased only slightly as a consequence ofindus trial processing from roasted to dried extracts. Any increase ocurring duringextraction is balanced by loss during drying. Schormüller et al. (1961) reportedaverage values of 2.20% citric acid, 0.50% malic acid, 0.45% lactic acid, 0.95%acetic acid and 0.08% pyruvic acid in dry instant coffee, to give a total of 4.18%,suggesting a marked increase in the level of acetic acid. Instant coffees derived frommedium-roasted arabica coffee tend to have higher acid contents than darklyroasted robusta. Average levels of 3.8% (German instant coffees) and 2.3% (Frenchinstant coffee) result in (76 and 46 mglcup), respectively.Trace elements: The main mineraI element in roasted and instant coffee ispotassium, and levels can range from 3.6 to 5.9% in dry instant coffee (Clarke, 1985).Maier (1981) compiled data on all other elements present or likely to be present. lninstant coffee, trace elements can originate both from the roasted coffee and fromthe water used for extraction: the content in the water can be at least tri pIed during',\n",

Instant coffee ismanufactured almost entirely in stainless-steel equipment, froID whichcontamination is minimal (Clarke, 1985).Other components: As a consequence of industrial extraction, higherpercentages of melanoidins (see p. 71), polysaccharides and 'proteins' are found ininstant coffee than in the soluble part of brewed coffee. Dissolution of a greateramount of polysaccharides is accompanied by sorne cleavage into constituentmonoses, indicated by the presence of small quantitites of arabinose, galactose andmannose (Trugo, 1985).(ii) Volatile compoundsLittle quantitative information and few comprehensive listings are available ofthe volatile compounds present in commercial instant coffee. Certain volatilecompounds, particularly sulfides and other non-polar substances, that occurpreferentiallyin the ail of roasted coffee rather than in the carbohydrate matrix wilbe present as a result of'aromatization' with coffee aiL. Over 80 volatile compoundswere identified in a commercial freeze-dried brew, including thiazoles, thiophenes,pyridines, pyrroles, pyrazines and furfurals (Dart & Nursten, 1985); the preparationwas relatively rich in the latter two groups of compounds. ln general, the volatilecompounds found in brewed coffee can be expected to occur, ta a greater or lesserextent.Carbonyls: Methylglyoxal has been quantified in instant coffee by derivativeGC (see also the monograph on methyIglyoxal, p. 445), at levels of 23 ppm Ü-ig/g;Hayashi & Shibamoto, 1985), 404-994 ppm (Shane et al., 1988) and 70-217 ppm(Aeschbacher et al., 1989). Kasai et al. (1982) found 100- 150 J1g/cup assuming 1.5 gof instant coffee for 100 ml water. Aeschbacher et al. (1989) also reported thepresence of 13-42 l1g/g diacetyl and 5-25 l1g/g glyoxal in dry product.Acids: The volatile and nonvolatile acid content of instant coffee is discussedabove (pp. 80 and 86).Esters: Methyl salicylate was found at 0-8.4 mg/l in nine samples of instantcoffee (2 g powder/1oo ml water; Swain et al., 1985).Furan- and sulfur-based compounds: Some compounds containing sulfur werequantified in instant coffee: furfuryl thiol, 3.90 ppm (mg/kg); 5-methyl furfurylmethyl disulfide, 0.015 mg/kg; and kahweofuran, 0.60 mg/kg. Three other furanshave also been quantified (Tressl & Silwar, 1981). ln general, these figures arecomparable with those for roasted coffee, but when they are calculated asmiligrams per cup they are quite low re.g., kahweofuran, 1.2 J1g/cup).Pyrones: Tressl (1980) found more maltol (60-120 ppm (mg/kg)) than wasexpected.\",\n",

Cyclotene, found at 70-110 mglg, ocurred at a higherlevel than would have been expected from roasted coffees (Tressl, 1980).No data were available to the Working Group on alcohols, nitrogencompounds, other sulfur compounds or phenols.(d) Compounds in decaffeinated coffeeUn der the Directives of the Commission of the European Communities (1977,1985), dry decaffeinated instant coffees must contain no more than 0.3% caffeine; inpractice, they contain less. This figure corresponds to 0- mglcup of instant coffeebrew, which also corresponds to that found (Barone & Roberts, 1984).The solvents used in decaffeination may remove small quantities of aromaprecursors, e.g., trigonellne, or increase their levels, e.g., ami no acids and reducingsugars.(e) Additives and contaminants(i) Flavouring additivesBoth roasted and instant coffees are largely marketed throughout the world as100% pure coffee products, and are clearly labelled as such in developed countries(Commission of the European Communities, 1985). Blends are also available withmany different kinds of roasted plant products, including chicory and malted andunmalted barley. Worldwide consumption in 1985 of dried chicory roots wasestimated at 128 () tonnes per annum, ofwhich 32% was consumed in France, 55%in other European countries and 12% in South Africa. After roasting, chicory ismixed with both roasted and instant coffee, but no information was available on thequantities used. The quantities consumed annually of mixures with barley varyconsiderably, in relation to the cast of coffee (Maier, 1987b).(ii) Othe, additivesPreservatives are not used. Occasionally, roasted and instant coffees havebeen used as vehicles for vitamins and mineraIs. Flow agents (sodium aluminiumsilcates) may be incorporated in instant coffees used in vending machines (by.national derogation in the Directive of the Commission of the EuropeanCommunities ).(ii) ContaminantsFor the purpose of this section of the monograph, the term 'contaminants' isused to mean those constituents sometimes present in the products, and therefore\",\n",
       " 'COFFEE89in the beverages derived from them, which are not essential to the flavour andproperties of the beverage. Sorne of these potential contaminants have knowntoxicological and, in sorne cases, carcinogenic effects.Mycotoxins: Numerous studies, especially since 1965, have been conducted onthe occurrence of mycotoxins in green coffee, and therefore in roasted and brewedcoffee, due to the presence of mouldy beans. These studies were reviewedcomprehensively by Strobel (1988b) and more briefly by Viani (1988). ln particular,aflatoxin B1 (see !AC, 1976a, 1987), ochratoxin A (see !AC, 1983, 1987) and, lessoften, sterigmatocystin (see lAC, 1976b) have been found in consignments ofgreen coffees containing mouldy beans, although regulations seek to prevent suchimportation. Levels of aflatoxin B1 at 3- 12 ppb (iig/kg) in 2% of samples analysed,of ochratoxin A at 0.5-360 ppb in 3.5% of samples, and of sterigmatocystin at 1140and 12 00. ppb in two very mouldy samples have been measured in sorne 2000consignments examined. Decaffeinated green coffee beans that have been allowedta go mouldy show a greater tendency ta develop toxins th an nondecaffeinatedcoffee on account of the absence of the inhibitory action of caffeine. Ochratoxin Awas found to be largely destroyed (80-99%) on roasting, as was aflatoxin Bh to aslightly lesser extent.Pesticides: Coffee beans are protected from pests within the cherry by directapplication of pesticides, details of which have been reported (Mitchell, 1988;Snoeck, 1988). Coffee itself is consumed in the producing countries only afterfurther processing, including roasting and brewing or extracting, which eliminatethese contaminants almost quantitatively. Viani (1988) compiled available data on~- and ß-hexachlorocyclohexanes, lindane, the DDT group, aldrin, dieldrin andothers. Of six instant coffee sam pIes, one contained 1.2 ng/g total hexachloro-cyclohexanes and one contained 3 ng/g lindane, but no other pesticide was found. lncontrast, 15 of 150 samples of green coffee had traces up to 290 ng/g lindane.Nitrosamines: N-Nitrosopyrrolidine (see IARC, 1978) was found in five of teninstant coffees at 0.3-1.4 ppb (i.tg/kg) by Sen and Seaman (1981). The presence ofthis nitrosamine has been confirmed in two of seven samples of instant coffee bymass spectrometry as weIl as by liquid chromatography-thermal energy analysis atlevels of 1.5 and 2.8 ppb (i.tg/kg). ln one of six samples of roasted, ground coffee,N-nitrosopyrrolidine was found at a level of 0.4 ppb (i.tg/kg) (Sen et aL., 1990).',\n",

Biological Data Relevant to the Evaluationof Carcinogenic Risk to Rumans3.1 CarcinogeDicity studies iD animaIs(a) Perinatal exsure/oral administrationMouse: ln a study available only as a preliminary report, groups of 150 maleand 150 female Swiss mice (CRL:COBS, CD-l) were mated at 12 weeks of age, andmothers of mi ce to be allocated to treated groups received 1% instant coffee in thedi et throughout gestation and lactation. After weaning, offspring were housedsingly and recived diets containing 0, 1, 2.5 or 5% (w/w) instant coffee (originunspecified) until the end of the experiment at 720 days. Increasing levels of coffeein the diet impaired the growth of animaIs, but better survival was noted in animaIsthat received the higher doses: at 24 months, the survival rate in the group receiving5% instant coffee was 50% compared with about 25% in controls. Tumours of theliver, lung and lymphatic tissue were observed frequently. The incidences ofbenignliver-cell tumours in males were 42/150 controls, 38/150 receiving 1%, 20/150receiving 2.5% and 16/150 receiving 5%; those in females were 2/150 controls, 2/150receiving 1%, 1/150 receiving 2.5% and 1/150 receiving 5%. Two hepatocellularcarcinomas were observed in one male mouse treated with 1% instant coffee and inone male mouse treated with 2.5%, but none was seen in mIce receiving 5% or incontrols. (The Working Group noted that hepatocellular tumours are common inSwiss mice.) No increase in the incidence of benign or malignant lung tumours wasobserved. Lymphosarcomas (aIl histological types) were observed in male andfemale control and treated animaIs. ln males, the incidence of these tumoursdecreased from 32% in controls to 12% in the high-dose group. ln females, no cleardose-dependent decrease was observed, although the incidence oflymphosarcomaswas 46% in controls and 18% in the high-dose group (Stalder et al., 1984). (TheWorking Group noted that the reduced numbers of liver adenomas in males and oflymphosarcomas in animaIs of each sex in the higher-dose groups might have beendue to impaired growth; these animaIs also had longer survivaL. Neither of thesefactors was taken into account in the analysis.)Rat: Groups of 55 male and 55 female F 1 Sprague- Dawley rats, five to sixweeks old, were given 25, 50 or 100% freshly brewed coffee as drinking fluid adlibitum for two years, at which time all survivors were killed.

Lower me an body weights were observed in males that received 100%coffee, and significantly increased mortality was seen in females given 50 and 100%coffee. Two statistical methods were used to adjust the incidence data for survivaldifferences: ln the first, which assumes that tumours are non-fatal (i.e., incidental),a significant increase in the number of tumour-bearing males was seen in thelow-dose group (relative risk (RR), 1.26; p .: 0.05) but in no other group. ln thesecond analysis, which assumes that tumours are lethal, increased numbers oftumour-bearing animaIs were seen among males in the low- and mid-dose groups(RR, 1.71,p .: 0.01 and 1.43,p .: 0.05, respectively) and among females in the mid-and high-dose groups (RR, 1.47, p .: 0.05 and 1.45, p .: 0.05, respectively) (Palm etal., 1984). (The Working Group noted that the first statistical analysis was moreappropriate, since the tumours were not the cause of death.)(h) Oral administrationRat: ln a study reported as a letter to the Editor of The Lancet, 144 male and144 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 21 days of age, were administered 5% instantcoffee in the diet for two years, at which time the survivors were kiled. An untreatedcontrol group of 41 males and 41 females was available. The urinary bladders of 94male and 99 female treated and 29 male and 29 female control animaIs wereexamined histologically. No hyperplasia or tumour of the urinary bladder wasobserved (Zeitlin, 1972). (The Working Group noted the incomplete reporting ofthe study: no information on survival was given, and only the bladder was examinedhistologically. JGroups of 40 male and 40 female Sprague- Dawley rats, weighingapproximately 100 g, were fed diets containing 6% of 13 different sam pIes of instantcoffee; caffeine had been removed by extraction with dichloromethane from sevenof the samples, but in three of these the caffeine had been put back. Treatment wasfor twe years, at which time aIl survivors were kiled. A control group of 40 malesand 40 females was available. Survival was similar in all groups, although malesgiven the decaffeinated coffees had slightly lower death rates, but the body weightsof treated males were lower th an those of controls. No increase in the incidence ofany type of tumour was noted. ln males in two of the six groups given instant coffeeand in one of the three groups given decaffeinated coffee plus caffeine (see also themonograph on caffeine p. 310), the incidence of benign and malignant tumours wassignificantly lowered (all p .: 0.05); in females, the decrease was not statisticallysignificant. A logistic regression analysis showed that the level of caffeinesignificantly lowered the incidence of tumours (Würzner et al., 1977a,b).

The concentration of coffee was increased gradually from 25%during the first two weeks to 100% within four weeks, which was continued for thelife span of the animaIs. AnimaIs were autopsied 15 months after the end ofazaserine treatment. The mean body weight of rats given the high- fat di et andcoffee was significantIy lower than that of the high-fat controls. The number ofpancreatic tumours was significantIy smaller in the group maintained on thehigh-fat diet and coffee than in the group on a high-fat diet only(44 adenomas versus176 lP ~ 0.(01) and 28 carcInomas versus 57 fp ~ 0.05)) (Woutersen et al., 1989).(The Working Group noted that the decrease could have been due, at least partIy, tothe impaired growth of the animaIs.)(ii) 7, 12-DimethylbenzlajanthraceneRat: Groups of 4041 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 53-55 days of age, weregiven a single intravenous injection of 7, 12-dimethylbenz(a )anthracene (DMBA) at20 mg/kg bw. Coffee (moderate or full strength) and decaffeinated (97%caffeine- free) coffee were given instead of drinking-water 29 days before up ta threedays after DMBA treatment; the experiment was terminated 12-18 weeks afterDMlA treatment.

After DMBAtreatment, all rats were palpated at two-week intervals for the presence of mammarytumours. When tumours reached 2 cm in diameter, theywere excIsed surgically,and the rat was placed back in the experiment. ln rats treated by intravenousadministration of DMBA, moderate and high doses of coffee significantIy (p ~0.05) reduced the number of mammary carcinomas per rat.

Groups of 20 female Syrian golden hamsters, weighingapproximately 70 g, were fed powdered chow or chow supplemented with 20%powdered green coffee beans. Two weeks later, the right buccal pouch of 16 animaIsfrom each group was painted three times with a 0.5% solution of DMBA in heavymineraI oil; the remaining four animaIs per group were treated three times weeklywith heavy mineraI ail alone and served as controls. The experiment was terminatedafter a total of 50 treatments (16.5 weeks). At the end of the experiment, 12/16animaIs given chow alone and 9/16 also given green coffee beans were stil alive;most of the losses were due to respiratory infections or ether anaesthesia. Tumoursof the buccal pouch were seen in 9/12 animaIs receiving chow (eight had multipletumours) and 2/9 also reciving green coffee beans. Two hamsters receiving chowhad mild to moderate dysplasia of the right buccal pouch and one had dysplasia,including carcinoma in situ; the buccal pouches of the nine remaining animaIs hadvarious grades of dysplasia, inc1uding carcinoma in situ and papilary carcinomas.Of the animaIs receiving green coffee beans, only two had carcinomas of the rightbuccal pouch; the remaining seven showed dysplasia.

Body weights of coffee-treated ratswere 6-7% lower than those of controls receiving water only. Coffee induced 'nountoward effect on the liver (Strubelt et al., 1973).Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed starch-based dietssupplemented with either brewed coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea, caffeine ornothing (controls). Compared with controls, rats consuming coffee or caffeine hadelevated concentrations of cholesterol and phospholipids. ln addition, both groupshad lower levels of triglycerides, although the difference was significant only for thegroup receiving caffeine (Naismith et al., 1969).Six male and nine female adult rhesus monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet adlibitum for 12 months. Major changes in the profiles of total plasma lipids andlipoproteins occurred within three to six months and remained at the higher levelthereafter. Four females and three males were then given 50% coffee as drinkingfluid for 12 months, while the remaining animaIs were given water. The authorsreported no significant difference in total plasma protein or lipids betweencoffee-treated and control animaIs after 15 and 18 months (Callahan et al., 1979).ln a study reported as an abstract, coffee did not enhance the number or size ofpancreatic atypical acinar-cell foci induced in rats by azaserine (Roebuck et aL.,1985).(iii) Effects on reproduction and prenatal toxicityBrewed coffee: ln a combined subchronic, reproductive and developmentaltoxicity study, Sprague-Dawley rats were given 12.5, 25 or 50% freshly percolated\",\n",

Parent rats treated with 50 and 100% coffee hadenlarged livers and kidneys, but no significant effect on reproduction or lactationwas observed. Body weights of F la offspring of the high-dose rats were comparableto those of con troIs at four days of age but had decreased significantly by weaning at21 days of age.

Offspring of damstreated with coffee prenatally had significantly decreased birth weights; no changein body weight was observed three or four days after birth (Muñoz et aL., 1986).Decaffeinated coffee: ln a combined subchronic, reproductive anddevelopmental toxicity study, Sprague-Dawley rats received 25, 50 or 100%decaffeinated brewed and instant coffee as the drinking fluid (equivalent ta 12, 25 or50 cups of coffee per day) with the same study design as described previously(Nole n, 1981).

Body weights of offspring of mid- and high-dose dams werecomparable to those of controls at four days of age but were significantly decreasedat weaning. No malformation or variation was observed in F lb offspring, and nodelay in ossification was seen (Nolen, 1982).ln a behavioural teratology study, Sprague- Dawley rats received freshlybrewed decaffeinated coffee (average daily caffeine intake, 4.5 mg/kg bw) as thedrinking fluid from the time of mating until parturition. A significant decrease inthe liver weights of the offspring was observed at birth, and a significant increase inmotor activity and a decrease in time spent grooming or with a novel object wereseen (Groisser et al., 1982).(iv) Genetic and related effectsThe genetic and related effects of various types of coffee have been reviewed(Sugimura, 1982; Sugimura & Sato, 1983; Aeschbacher et al., 1984a; Nagao et aL.,1984; Sugimura et al., 1984; Nagao et al., 1986b; Aeschbacher, 1990). ln bacteria,there is evidence that dicarbonyls (e.g., methylglyoxal) and hydrogen peroxideacting together contribute to the mutagenic activity of roasted coffee (Nagao et al.,1984; Fujita et al., 1985a,b). Both the dicarbonyls and hydrogen peroxide may bedeactivated by enzymes present in ce lis and tissue, such as glyoxalase, glutathione',\n",

There is substantial evidence in various genetic test systems, with oneexception (Graf & Würgler, 1986), that caffeine is not involved in the genetic activityobserved (Nagao et al., 1979; Aeschbacher, 1990).Coffee has been studied in experimental genetic and related systems as bothinstant coffee powders and as finely ground roasted coffee beans prepared withwater in the normal way for drinking and then lyophilized. The doses are expressedas mass of coffee powder used in the treatment, which generally required thepowder to be dissolved in the treatment solvent. Sterilization of preparations to betested for bacterial mutagenicity, by filtration or autoclaving, did not influence theresults significantly (Aeschbacher et al., 1980). Time between sample preparationand test may affect the genetic response. ln several studies, where specificallynoted, the coffee was solvent-extracted or chemically fractionated. Studies inbacteria of green coffee beans indicate a lack of mutagenic activity (Kosugi et al.,1983; Albertini et al., 1985; Dorado et al., 1987); similar comparisons of roasted andunroasted beans have not been made with other systems.The results of the studies on genetic and related effects are listed at the end ofthis section in Table 29, with the evaluation of the Working Group, as positive,negative or inconclusive, as defined in the footnotes. The results are tabulatedseparately for the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolic activationsystem. The lowest effective dose (LED), in the case of positive results, and thehighest ineffective dose (HID), in the case of negative results, are shown togetherwith the appropriate reference. The studies are summarized briefly below.Brewed coffee: Freshly brewed coffee induced prophage lambda in IysogenicEscherichia coli K12.A number of studies have been conducted on the mutagenicity of coffees toSalmonella tyhimurium under different conditions. Brewed coffee consistentlyinduced mutations in S. tyhimurium TAI00, and mutations were also induced inTAI02 and TAI04, which are more sensitive to oxidative mutagens, and in E. coliWP2 uvrA/pKMI01. There are conflicting reports on the mutagenicity of coffee toS. typhimurium TA98. (The Working Group noted the inadequate reporting ofseveral of the studies with TA98.) Coffee gave negative results in standard strains ofS. tyhimurium, which do not contain the pKMI0l plasmid. Brewed coffee was alsomutagenic in theS. typhimurium L-arabinose-resistance forward mutation assay instrain BA13.There was no significant response in tests for sex-linked recessive lethalmutation, dominant lethal mutation or chromosome loss in Drosophila',\n",

Theseeffects were attributed to caffeine.Treatment of cultured human lymphocytes with brewed coffee induced sisterchromatid exchange, gaps, breaks and total chromosomal aberrations.Endoreduplicated cells were induced in Chinese hamster ovary AUXBl cells.Bisulfite, which complexes carbonyls, reduced the frequency of sister chromatidexchange and endoreduplicated cells, while catalase and peroxidase treatment hadno effect (Tucker et al., 1989). Coffee aroma stripped from roasted coffee beans alsoinduced gaps, breaks and total chromosomal aberrations in hum an peripherallymphocytes.Instant coffee: Instant coffee induced prophage lambda in lysogenic E. coliK12, strain GY5027 but did not induce SOS activity in S. tyhimuriumTAI535/pSKl002.Instant coffee induced mutations in S. typhimurium TAl00 but not in TA98,TA1535, TA1537 or TA1538. Instant coffees were mutagenic ta S. tyhimuriumstrains TAI02 and TAI04, which are more sensitive ta oxidative mutagens. Instantcoffee was also active in the S. tyhimurium L-arabinose-resistance forwardmutation assay in strain BA13. The mutagens in coffee are inactivated by thecytosolic fraction of exogenous metabolic systems from rat liver, by heat in thepresence of oxygen (Friederich et aL., 1985), by sodium sulfite (Suwa et al., 1982) andby catalase (Fujita et al., 1985b). This evidence, together with that from otherstudies, led ta the conclusion that an interaction of methylglyoxal with hydrogenperoxide accounts for most of the mutagenicity of instant coffee (Fujita et aL.,1985a, b ).Negative results were obtained in host-mediated assays in which coffee wasadministered to male Swiss mice by gavage after intraperitoneal injection of S.tyhimurium TA1530. Similarly, negative results were obtained in theintrasanguinous test following intravenous injection of E. coli K12 into male Swissmi ce and assaying for reverse and forward mutation at the nia + and gal+ loci,respectively.Treatment of Chinese hamster lung cells with instant coffee increased thefrequency of mutations in the diphtheria toxin resistance assay. Most of themutagenicity was suppressed by sodium bisulfite. Methylglyoxal was shawn taaccount for less than 3% of the mutagenicity (Nakasato et aL., 1984).There was no significant response in tests for sex-linked recessive lethalmutation, dominant lethal mutation or chromosome loss in Drosophilamelanogaster, but weak activity was observed in the somatic cell (wing imaginaI',\n",

Theseeffects were attributed to caffeine.Treatment of cultured human lymphocytes with instant coffee induced gaps,breaks and total chromosomal aberrations. Sister chromatid exchange andendoreduplicated cells were induced in Chinese hamster ovary AUXB 1 cells(Tucker et al., 1989).Instant coffee administered ta Chinese hamsters as a single oral dose did notincrease the frequency of sister chromatid exchange. ln a micronucleus test, Swissmice were given five consecutive daily oral doses of instant coffee; no significantinduction of micronuclei above spontaneous levels was observed. Two oral doses toSwiss mi ce of coffee aroma (up to 50 ml/kg bw) also gave negative results(Aeschbacher et al., 1984b). ln another study, no significant increase in thefrequency of micronuclei was induced by single or multiple administrations ofinstant coffee by gavage (Shimizu & Yano, 1987). (The Working Group noted thatthe authors reported a tendency for the number of micronuclei to increase in adose-related fashion.)Decaffeinated coffee: Decaffeinated coffee induced prophage lambda inlysogenic E. coli K12, strain GY5027. It induced mutation in S. typhimurium TA98,TA100, TAI02 and TAI04, which are sensitive to oxidative mutagens. No effect wasobserved in Drosophila melanogasterwhen decaffeinated coffee was assayed for theinduction of somatic cell (wing imaginaI disc) mutation and mitotic recombination.Treatment of cultured human lymphocytes with decaffeinated coffee induced gaps,breaks and total chromosomal aberrations. Sister chromatid exchange andendoreduplicated cells were induced in Chinese hamster ovary AUXBl cells(Tucker et al., 1989).Coffee in combination with known mutagens: Brewed coffee, instant coffee anddecaffeinated coffee suppressed SOS induction by ultra-violet light,2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in S. tyhimurium TA1535/pSKI002 (Obana et al.,1986). Instant, decaffeinated and brewed coffee inhibited mutagenesis resultingfrom the nitrosation of methylurea in S. tyhimurium TA1535 (Stich et al., 1982).ln mouse bone-marrow micronucleus tests, positive responses to mitomycin C,cyclophosphamide and procarbazine (but not adriamycin) were significantlyreduced by administration of instant coffee 2 h before the clastogens. Similareffects were observed with decaffeinated and brewed coffee on the micronucleatingeffect of mitomycin C, and with brewed coffee on the effect of procarbazine(Abraham, 1989). ln contras t, it has been reported that instant coffee caused nosignificant alteration in the incidence of micronuclei induced by N-nitroso-dimethylamine (Shimizu & Yano, 1987).\",\n",

       " 'COFFEE103(h) Humans(i) Toxic effectsCoffee drinking has been associated with a number of adverse effects(Goldman, 1984; Spiler, 1984c; Stone, 1987). Many of the undesirable effects ofcoffee have been ascribed ta caffeine, and they are dealt with in the respectivemonograph; at least sorne of the effects of coffee on plasma cholesterol and lipids,however, can be attributed ta ingredients other than caffeine.A weak association was seen between coffee drinking and total mortalityamong men in a 25-year follow-up from the Netherlands. No cause-specificmortality was reported (Vandenbroucke et al., 1986).Plasma cholesterol and lipoproteins: A series of epidemiological studies haveinvestigated possible associations between coffee drinking and serum cholesterollevels; these have been reviewed (Thelle et al., 1987). Many of the studies found thatcoffee consumption was positively associated, ta variable degrees, with levels oftotal serum cholesterol in people of each sex (Thelle et al., 1983; Kark et al., 1985;Klatsky et al., 1985; Tuomilehto et al., 1987; Ara et al., 1989). Other investigatorsfound sorne association in men or women (Nichais et al., 1976; Shirlow & Mathers,1984; Mathias et al., 1985; Curb et al., 1986; Pietinen et al., 1988) or in only somesegments of the general population, e.g., individuals with coronary heart disease(Little et al., 1966) or hypertension (Davis et al., 1988). There are also a number ofstudies in which no association was observed (Philips et aL., 1981; Hofman et aL.,1983; Kovar l:t al., 1983; Aro et al., 1985; Donahue et al., 1987; Paoletti et aL., 1989).Only a few scientists have investigated the relationship between coffeeconsumption and the concentration of individual serum lipoproteins. A positiveassociation was observed between the level of low-density lipoproteins and coffeeintake, whereas no such relation was seen with high-density lipoproteins ortriglycerides (Førde et al., 1985; Aro et al., 1987; Bak & Grobbee, 1989; Paoletti et al.,1989).The conflicting data on the effects of coffee on serum cholesterol may be due tathe use of different methods in the preparation of coffee. Thus, boiled coffee, butnot filtered coffee, raised serum cholesterol (0.5-1.0 mmol/l) in three separateclinical trials conducted in Norway, Finland and the Netherlands (Førde et al., 1985;Aro et al., 1987; Bak & Grobbee, 1989). Epidemiological observations agree withthe results of these clinical trials (Stensvold et al., 1989; Pietinen et al., 1990). Zock etal. (1990) suggest that a nonsaponifiable lipid fraction, isolated from boiled coffeeby ultracentrifugation, raised serum cholesterol in healthy volunteers.',\n",
       " \"104IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51Coronary heart disease: The results of the Boston Collaborative DrugSuiveilance Program (1972) suggest that consumption of more than five cups ofcoffee per day doubles the risk for rnyocardial infarction, as compared to noconsumption at all. SimIlar results were reported by other investigators (Jick et al.,1973; Mann & Thorogoo, 1975; LaCroix et al., 1986; LeGrady et al., 1987;Rosenberg et al., 1988). Sorne established only a modest association betweenmyocardial infarction and heavy coffee consumption and for only some segments ofthe population (Rosenberg et al., 1980, 1987; La Vechia et al., 1989a). Severalotherepidemiological studies found no association (Klatsky et al., 1973; Dawber et al.,1974; Hennekens et al., 1976).ln sorne studies, the apparent assoiation between coffee drinking andischaemic heart disease can be accunted for by cigarette smoking (Hennekens etal., 1976; Wilhelmsen et al., 1977; La Vechia et al., 1989a).(Te Working Group was not aware of any longitudinal study on theassociation between coffee intake and the risk of coronary heart disease frompopulations with high consumption of boiled coffee.)(ii) Effects on reproduction and prenatal toxicityThe reproductive effects of coffee on hum ans have been reviewed (Ernster,1984; Leviton, 1984; James & PaulI, 1985; Pieters, 1985; HelIer, 1987; Schneider,1987; Leviton, 1988). Most epidemiological studies have ben affected by a nurnberof methodological issues, including (i) inadequate measurement of intake: almostail studies relied on reported intakes; some studies were lImited to coffeeconsumption and ignored other sources of caffeine; and rnost studies ignoreddistinctions between different types of preparation and different strengths ofcoffee; (ii) inadequate control for the possible confounding effects of variables suchas smoking, alcohol consurnption, age, nutrition and life-style factors in somestudies; (ii) low response rates in several studies; (iv) biased selection of adequatecontrols because of self-selection into groups of drinkers and nondrinkers of coffee;(v) recall bias in retrospective studies, particularly those of malformations; and (vi)insuffcient statistical power in sorne of the studies. Despite these limitations,epiderniological studies are the single source of information on human reproductiveeffects of coffee.Malformtions: Borlée et al. (1978) identified 202 infants with congenitalmalformations of any'type among 17 970 births in eight Belgian hospitals between1972 and 1974. A group of 175 control infants was also selected. The parents ofcases and con troIs were interviewed about consumption of coffee and otherpossible risk factors. Compared to women who did not drink coffee, the relativerisks (RR) were calculated by the Working Group to be (0.7) for women drinkingone to four cups per day, (0.8) for those drinking five to seven cups and (1.5) for\",\n",
       " 'COFFEE105those drinking eight or more cups. ln a chi-square test, the linear trend was barelysignificant ((p = 0.05)). No significant association was found between coffeedrinking and smoking or use of medicines. (The Working Group noted that noinformation was given on refusaIs or other losses, that the possibility of recall biaswas not considered, and that there was no proper control of confounding variables.)Jacobson et al. (1981) reported three cases of infants with ectrodactyly born tawomen who drank eight to 25 cups of percolated coffee per day. The women wereselected from among those who contacted the authors after reading press accountsof the relationship between coffee drinking and malformations. (The WorkingGroup noted that this letter to the Editor constitutes only anecdotal information.)Linn et al. (1982) studied the association between coffee consumption andseveral outcomes of pregnancy in 12 205 women in Boston, MA USA, in 1977-80,who represented 71% of women giving birth in one hospitaL. Women wereintervewed one to two days after delivery about their previous medical andobstetric history and habits, including coffee and tea consumption during the firsttrimester. Diabetic and asthmatic women and those with multiple pregnancieswere excluded. The analysis was controlled for a number of confounding factors.No association was found between coffee drinking and the frequency ofmalformations.The association between drinking caffeine-containing beverages and six typesof malformation (inguinal hernia, oral cleft, cardiac defects, pyloric stenosis andneural tube defects) was studied in a case-cntrol study of 2030 children from anumber of hospitals in Boston, MA, Philadelphia, PA, and Toronto, Canada,between 1976 and 1980 (Rosenberg et al., 1982). Controls were 712 children withother malformations, mainly of the gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and centralnervous systems. Mothers were interviewed in their homes within six months ofdelivery about consumption of a number of caffeine-containing beverages,including coffee, tea and cola. Consumption of coffee was 0, ocasion al, 1-2 or :: 3cups per day. No association was found between coffee consumption and any of thesix malformations (all RRs, --1.4). Adjustment for a large number of potentiallyconfounding variables - but not for alcohol consumption - in the analysis did notchange these estimates. (The Working Group noted that the use of malformedinfants as con troIs helps reduce recall bias, but it might be inadequate if caffeinewere a teratogen that affects many sites.)A monitoring system identified 755 children with birth defects in Finlandbetween 1980 and 1982 (Kurppa et al., 1983) including 112 with central nervoussystem defects, 241 with orofacIal clefts, 210 with musculoskeletal defects and 143with cardiovascular malformations.

No important difference was seenbetween mothers of cases and of contraIs regarding the consumption of coffeeduring pregnancy. After adjustment for maternai age, smoking and alcoholconsumption, the RR for coffee drinkers relative to those who did not drink coffeewas 1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.8-1.3). Separate analyses of the fourdiagnostic categories showed no significant association.As reported in an abstract, a case-control study of risk factors for c1eft palatewas carried out in five areas of Japan from 1978 to 1981. One control was matchedta each of 194 cases for residence, sex, birth order and maternaI age.Questionnaires answered by mothers inc1uded information on dietary habits.Frequent intake of coffee was associated with a RR of 2.3 (p ~ 0.05) (Tohnai et aL.,1984).Furuhashi et al. (1985) carried out a prospective study in Japan in which 9921women at 24 weeks' gestation or more were interviewed about coffee and teadrinking. Women were divided into five consumption groups: those who drankneither tea nor coffee, drinkers of fewer than five cups of coffee per day, five or morecups of coffee per day, coffee (any quantity) plus green te a, and green tea only. Therates of congenital anomalies of any type were 3.7% among coffee and/or teadrinkers and 1.7% among women who drank neither beverage. (The WorkingGroup calculated that this difference was highly significant (p .. 0.001), althoughthe authors stated the opposite.) The association with coffee drinking wasparticularly strong for multiple anomalies. (The Working Group noted that no dataare given on how the women were selected, or on when and where the study wascarried out. Data on refusaIs and losses ta folIow-up are not given. Confoundingvariables were not adjusted for. It was surprising that the excess risk was seen for awide variety of congenital malformations, inc1uding those associated withchromosomal anomalies.)Tikkanen and Heinonen (1988) carried out a case-control study of maternaiexposure to organic solvents and cardiovascular malformations in Finland in1982-84. The 569 cases were identified from a population-based registry ofcongenital malformations; ail diagnoses were confirmed by a cardiologist withexperience in teratology. Controls were selected randomly from 52 hospitals in thecountry, and of 1200 con troIs selected, 1052 (88%) were inc1uded in the study.Mothers were interviewed at maternity welfare centres concerning exposuresduring the first trimester of pregnancy.

Thewomen were intervewed during the first trimester of pregnancy, but littleinformation was provided on how coffee drinking was quantified. Compared tonondrinkers, women who ocasionally drank coffee had a RR of (1.4); frequentdrinkers had a RR of (1.6) for delivering a low birthweight ( .: 2500 g) baby ((p .:0.01)). The risk among drinkers remained unchanged after stratification forsmoking (as reanalysed by Rogue, 1981).van den Berg (1977) studied the effect of coffee consumption on birthweightand preterm delivery in a prospetive study carried out in California, USA, between196 and 1967. Approximately 15 00 pregnant women reciving antenatal careun der a prepaid medical plan were enrolled. Data were obtained from theirmedical recrds as well as from interviews covering reproductive history,socioeconomic factors, smoking habits and beverage consumption. Adose- response effect of coffee drinking was seen on low birthweight (see Table 30). Asimilar effect was noted on prematurity (gestational age under 37 weeks at birth),with RRs of (1.3) for women drinking two to six cups per day and (1.8) for thosedrinking seven or more cups, compared to women drinking up to one cup per day.Hogue (1981) examined the data on low birthweight after adjustment for smokingand length of gestation: a smaller but stil significant RR of 1.2 was found for womenwho drank seven or more cups per day as compared to women who drank fewer thanseven cups per day.Arnandova and Kaculov (1978) reported a study of the pregnancy outcomes of60 women in the US SR in 1976. Coffee consumption was not associated withprematurity, but the mean birthweight of infants born to coffee drinkers (usuallyone to two cups per day) was 115 g less than that of babies of women who did notdrink coffee. The authors commented that this difference was probably due togreater . consumption of alcohol and tobacc among coffee drinkers.Kuza and Sokol (1982) carried out a study of pregnant women who gave birthat four hospitals in California, USA, in 1974-78. About three-quarters of the womenreceiving antenatal care in these hospitals answered a self-administeredquestionnaire on their first visit, which included information on demographic andsocioenomic variables and on the use of coffee, alcohol, tobacco and othersubstances. If a mother had not sought antenatal care or had been missed in theenrollment procedure, the same data were obtained shortly after delivery; 37% ofthe study sample was recruited in this way. No important difference was foundbetween information collected prospectively and retrospectively. Complete datawere available for 5093 mother-infant pairs. Afer adjustment for gestational age,pre-pregnancy weight, weight gain, ethnicity and smoking, caffeine use wassignificantly (p .: 0.01) associated with lower birthweight. (The Working Group',\n",

(1982), described on p. 105, coffee drinking during thefirst trimester was associated in the crude analysis with a greater proportion of lowbirthweight. After adjustment for smoking, with or without other confoundingvariables, no significant effect of coffee drinking was seen: the RR for womendrinking four or more cups a day was 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9-1.6) (see Table 30). Nodose-response effect was present, and the association between coffee drinking andduration of gestation was nonsignificant.ln a case-control study, Berkowitz et al. (1982) compared 175 preterm infantsand 313 term infants delivered at a Connecticut, USA, hospital in 1977. Preterminfants (cases) were defined as those barn before 37 weeks of gestation, asdetermined by the Dubowitz criteria, and controls were a random sample of terminfants. Interviews were completed with the mothers of 86% of potential cases and95% of potential contraIs and included data on alcohol, smoking and on the averagedaily number of cups of coffee or tea taken during each trimester. Cases were oflower socioeconomic status than contrais. Coffee drinking was not associated withshortened gestation periodeWatkinson and Fried (1985) investigated the possible association betweencoffee consumption during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes among women in theOttawa area, Canada. From 1978, 371 women were studied for a range of perinataloutcomes. Five years later, in 1983, those women whose offspring were at least oneyear of age by that date were mailed a questionnaire concerning their consumptionof coffee, tea, cola and other sources of caffeine throughout their pregnancies; 28women (77%) responded. Coffee and tea sam pIes were collected from 53 mothersand were used to estimate the caffeine content of these drinks. Caffeineconsumption was greater among smokers and among women of low educationalleveL. Caffeine intake, expressed as a continuous variable, was not significantlyassociated with birthweight or gestational age; however, the mean weight of babiesborn to 12 heavy users (~300 mg caffeine/day) was 3158 g, compared to 3537 g forthe remaining sample (p -( 0.05). This association was stil significant afteradjustment for nicotine use but not quite significant (p = 0.06) after controllng formaternaI education. No association was found between heavy use and gestationalage. (The Working Group noted that women had been asked ta recall the intake of anumber of caffeine-containing substances several years after a pregnancy. Nodose-response effect was present.ln the study of Furuhashi et al (1985), described on p. 106, no significantdifference in mean birthweight was seen between the five categories.

(The Working Groupnoted that no information on smoking was available, and no definition was given of'small for gestational age'.)Martin and Bracken (1987) carred out a prospetive study of 3891 pregnantwomen reciving antenatal care in greater New Haven, Connecticut, USA, between1980 and 1982. A total of 6219 women were considered for the study but only 5331agreed to be contacted. Of these, 4926 fulflled the entiy criteria, and 85% wereintervewed at home withln a few weeks of the first prenatal visit. Caffeineconsumption during pregnancy was estimated from data on the consumption ofcoffee, tea, colas and drugs. Data on pregnancy outcomes were obtained fromhospital recrds and were analysed using logistic regression. Caffeine consumptionwas associated with lower socioenomic status, smoking and alcohol intake. Theeffect of caffeine on birthweight was restricted to term infants. After adjustment forgestational age, race, parity and smoking, intake of caffeine at ~ 30 mglday wasassociated with a RR of 4.6 (95% CI, 2.0-10.5) for low birthweight compared withthat of women who did not consume caffeine-containing beverages or drugs. Adose-response pattern was present (see Table 30). No association was seen betweencaffeine intake and gestational age.Brooke et al. (1989) studied the effects on birthweight of smoking, alcohol,caffeine, socioenomic factors and psychosocial stress among 186 white womenin London, UK of whom 1513 were. included in the study and interviewedprenatalIy. Birthweight was corrected for gestational age, maternaI height, parityand baby's sex (adjusted to a standard population). Smoking was found to be themost important single factor, inducing a 5% reduction in birthweight, which wasstatistically significant even when corrected for consumption of alcohol, tea, coffeeor caffeine. Total caffeine consumption (miligrams per week) was calculated forthe entire pregnancy and was found to be related ta birthweight (adjusted to 40weeks): with an intake of 0-20 mglday, birth weight was 36 g; with 20-40mglday, birthweight was 36 g; and with a daily intake of more than 40 mglday,the average birthweight was 3556 g. The corresponding birthweight ratios were1.050, 1.034 and 1.019. ln a cru de analysis (not corrected for smoking), thedifference across groups gives p = 0.005; however, when corrected for smoking, theadjusted birthweight ratios did not differ with cafeine consumption categories,being 1.051 (95% CI, 1.039-1.062) for 0-20 mglday, 1.055 (95% CI, 1.043-1.068) for20 mglday and 1.054 (95% CI, 1.033-1.075) for ~ 40 mglday. The authorsconcluded that smoking was the main environmenta cause of variations inbirthweight (corrected for gestational age). (Te Working Group noted that the\",\n",
       " \"COFFEE111study was not designed to detect a possible effect on birthweight mediated throughprematurity.)ln Costa Rica, women of low socioeconomic status were contacted at anantenatal care service before they were six months' pregnant (Muñoz et al., 1988).Of 378 women contacted, 301 fulfilled the entry criteria, which included being agedbetween 17 and 30 years, uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, term ddivery,avoidance of smoking and alcohol, and initiation of breastfeeding. The study wasrestricted to non-coffee drinkers and to women who drank 450 ml or more coffee perday. Of 110 eligible women, 62 (56%) dropped out, sa that the study was limited ta22 coffee drinkers and 26 who did not drink coffee. Dropouts had had lesseducation and higher parity than the women studied. Birthweight was 121 g lowerfor the children of coffee drinkers than those of non-coffee drinkers (p ~ 0.(01).This difference was stil significant after adjustment for potential confoundingfactors through multiple linear regression. Iron deficiency anaemia was found in23% of the coffee Consumers and in none of the non-consumers. The haematocritlevels of infants of coffee-drinking mothers at one week and one month of age werelower th an those of the contraIs. This association persisted after adjustment forconfounding factors. (The Working Group noted the high rate of dropouts.)The effect of first-trimester maternaI caffeine consumption on birthweight wasexamined in a case-control study of 131 cases and 136 controls (Caan & Goldhaber,1989). Heavy consumption of caffeine (300 mg/day or three servings) from coffee,tea or cola drinks was associated with a high prevalence of low birthweight. Forwomen who had drunk three or more cups of coffee per day, the crude odds ratiowas 2.1; when adjusted for ethnicity, alcohol, cigarettes, pre-pregnancy weight,weight gain and parity, the odds ratio increased ta 2.8 (95% Ci; 0.89-8.7).Spontaneous abortions and stillbirths: ln the study of Arnandova and Kaculov(1978), described on p. 108, no difference was reported in the rates of spontaneousabortions and stilbirths in relation to coffee drinking.ln the study of Furuhashi et al. (1985), described on p. 106, 2% of pregnantwomen who had drunk coffee and 1.2% of contraIs had spontaneous abortions(p ~ 0.(01). (Reservations regarding this study are given on p. 106. The WorkingGroup noted further that most abortions are likely to have been missed in thisstudy, since women were recruited at 24 weeks' gestation or more. It is unclearwhether stilbirths were included among abortions since there was no mention ofstilbirths in the report. No confounding variable was adjusted for.)Srisuphan and Bracken (1986) carried out a prospective study of 3 135 pregnantwomen who had sought antenatal care in the New Haven, Connecticut, area, USA,between 1980 and 1982. Details of the study design are given on p. 110 in thedescription of the study by Martin and Bracken (1987).

       " '112IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51moderate-to-heavy users (~150 mg/day) (trend not significant). Comparingmoderate-to-heavy users with the remainder, the RR was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.0-2.7;p =0.03). This estimate was unchanged (RR, 1.7; p = 0.03) after adjustment formaternaI age, gestational age, Jewish religion, prior gynaecological surgery andprevious spontaneous abortions. Women who received caffeine only from coffeeappeared to have a higher risk of miscarriage (RR, 2) than those who drank only tea(1.1) or colas (1.3), but the numbers were small and the differences not significant.Krınjavi and Mimica (1987) studied 308 pregnant women in Zagreb,Yugoslavia, in 1982-83, ofwhom 246 (80%) responded to a questionnaire on alcohol,tobacco and coffee consumption. No association was found between coffeedrinking and the frequency of spontaneous abortions.Effects on fertility Information on caffeine consumption before trying taconceive was obtained for 221 women. The adjusted mean fecundability ratio forhigher caffeine users compared to non-users was 0.80 (Wilcox et al., 1988). Anassociation between reduced fertilty and caffeine intake received further supportfrom data presented in a letter to the Editor of The Lancet (Christianson et al.,1989). ln a further study, however, no association was found between time taconceive and coffee consumption among 2817 women who had recently had aliveborn chi Id, while there was a suggested effect of tea and also of age and tobaccosmoking (Joesoef et al., 199).(iii) Genetic and related effectsThe non polar fractions of urine from humans who had ingested 12 g of instantcoffee per day for four days or 12 g within 2 h were not mutagenic to S. typhimuriumTA98 or TAl00 in the presence or absence of an exogenous metabolic system, withor without ß-glucuronidase treatment of the urine (Aeschbacher & Chappuis,1981).Organic fractions isolated from the urine of drinkers of at least five cups ofcoffee per day induced chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamsterovary cells. This clastogenic effect was abolished in two of the organic fractions bythe addition of either catalase or superoxide dismutase to the cell system, suggestingthat active oxygen species are involved (Dunn & Curtis, 1985).ln a population of 30 smokers and 30 nonsmokers, a positive, statisticallysignificant linear relationship between the square-root transformed frequency ofsister chromatid exchange in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes and coffeeconsumption was reported (Reidy et al., 1988). ln the same population, a positivelinear relationship was observed between the average number of cups of coffeeconsumed per day and the proportion of low-folate cultured blood lymphocyteswith chromosomal aberrations.

Ecological studies examining geographicvariation in coffee consumption and either cancer incidence or mortality rates(Takahashi, 1964; Stocks, 1970; Shennan, 1973; Armstrong & Doll, 1975; Binstock etaL., 1983; Decarli & La Vecchia, 1986; Phelps & Phelps, 1988) are the most common.A second type of study examines time trends in cancer rates and coffeeconsumption within a given country or countries (Morrison, 1978; Pannelli et aL.,1989). A hybrid design combines an examination of time trends (Cuckle & Kinlen,1981; Benarde & Weiss, 1982) and geographic differences among countries. Thefinal type of descriptive studies examines cancer rates among special populationgroups such as Mormons, a cultural group one of whose practices is abstensionfrom tea and coffee drinking (Enstrom, 1975; Lyon et al., 1976; Enstrom, 1978, 1980;Lyon et aL., 1980), in which incidence and mortality rates for different cancer siteswere compared either wi th the general population or wi th non - practising Mormons.It is not possible in these studies, however, to distinguish between the effect ofreduced coffee and tea consumption, reduced cigarette smoking and alcoholdrinking and the other prohibited behaviours of this sect; they do not contribute taour knowledge of the association between coffee drinking and cancer risk and arenot discussed further in this monograph.(i) Bladder cancerln an examination of time trends in incidence rates and per-caput coffeeimports in the USA and Denmark, coffee consumption was adjusted for cigaretteconsumption.

Cohort and period variation inbladder cancer mortality in Italy between 1950-54 and 1980-81 was compared withchanges in coffee, cocoa, tea and cigarette consumption. The authors stated thatchanges in coffee intake do not explain the cohort changes (Pannell et al., 1989). Noassociation was noted in the study of either Armstrong and Doll (1975) or Stocks(1970).(ii) Breast cancerWeak positive correlations were reported between incidence (r = 0.42) andmortality (r = 0.37) from breast cancer and coffee consumption in a geographicalstudy (Armstrong & Doll, 1975). Phelps and Phelps (1988) conducted an ecologicalstudy, which did not distinguish between tea and coffee consumption, and reporteda correlation of 0.00 with breast cancer mortality ratios after adjusting for dietaryfat intake.(iii) Endometrial cancerA positive correlation was reported between the incidence of corpus uterinecancer (r = 0.43) and international variation in coffee consumption (Armstrong &Doll, 1975).(iv) Kidney cancerThe correlation between age-adjusted mortality rates from kidney cancer in1964 and per-caput coffee consumption was 0.79 (p c( 0.(01) (Shennan, 1973). Areported correlation between coffee consumption and the incidence of kidneycancer (men, 0.62; women, 0.40) was explained by the stronger association withconsumption of animal protein (Armstrong & Doll, 1975), which is also correlatedwith coffee consumption.(v) LeukaemiaA positive correlation was reported between mean, age-adjusted mortalityrates for leukaemia in 1964-65 and annual coffee consumption (males, p = 0.001;females, p = 0.03) (Stocks, 1970).(vi) Ovarian cancerA positive correlation was reported between mean, age-adjusted mortalityrates in 196465 and annual coffee consumption (p = 0.00) (Stocks, 1970).

An additional correlation study in the USA, which used lag periods taexamine trends in mortality ratios and coffee consumption, reported correlationcoefficients ranging from 0.39 ta 0.68 over the peri ad of the study (Benarde & Weiss,1982). A simple correlation coefficient of 0.59 (p = 0.001) between coffeeconsumption in 1957-65 and mortality in 1971-74 was found ta be significant aftercontrolling for confounding variables (Binstock et al., 1983).

The studies are summarized in Table 31 on p. 119.(i) AlI sites combinedHeyden et al. (1979) conducted a nine-year follow-up of 2530 US men andwomen interviewed about their daily coffee consumption in 1967-69. Seventy-fourcancer deaths with biopsy or hospital data were analysed. Two sets of controlsconsisted of age-, race- and sex-matched deaths from cardiovascular disease andlive study participants. Coffee consumption was more corn mon among each set ofcon troIs than among the cancer cases (odds ratio, 0.67; p / 0.05). Thematched-pairs odds ratios were based on 6:9 discordant pairs for each set of.con troIs.The association between coffee consumption and mortality from aIl causes,coronary heart disease and noncoronary causes over 19 years was examined among1910 white men, aged 40-56 at the time of the baseline examination, who took part ina study of the Chicago Western Electric Company (LeGrady et aL., 1987).

The adjusted RR forcancers at all sites comparing none to one cup per day with all other levels of intakewas 1.6 (95% CI, 0.95-2.6). (Te Working Group noted that no analysis ofsite-specific cancer risks was undertaken.)(ii) Site-specife anaysesA case-control analysis of a cohort study investigated pancreatic cancermortality in a 16-50-year follow up of 50 () male former college students(Whittemore et al., 1983). There were 12 deaths from pancreatic cancer. Data oncoffee and tea consumption and other variables had been collected during aphysical examination at college. No significant association was noted with coffeeconsumption.A series of letters to the Editor of The Lancet (Nomura et al., 1981; KInlen et al.,1984; Nomura et al., 1984) report pancreatic cancer incidence in cohort studies.Since Nomura et al. (1986) reported on pancreatic cancer and coffee consumption inthe same cohort, no additional data from these letters are reported here. Kinlen etal. (1984) carried out a cohort study of 14 085 men in London, UK. There were 47deaths from pancreatic cancer, identified from death certificates, in the 13 years offollow-up to 1982. The me an daily consumption of coffee, adjusted for age andsmoking, was 0.83 cup for cases and 1.00 cup for controls.ln a Hawaiian cohort study of the association between cancer incidence andcoffee consumption, 7355 Japanese men were followed for a minimum of 14 yearsfrom the time of collection of 24-h consumption data in 1965-68 (Nomura et al.,1986). There were 672 incident cancers in the cohort as of J uly 1983. Incidence rateswere adjusted for age or both age and smoking, using the entire cohort as thestandard population. The reference category for all analyses included the 1173 menwho reported drinking no coffee. Coffee intake was analysed accrding to none, oneta two, three to four and five or more cups per day. No significant association wasreported between coffee drinking and age- and smoking-adjusted RRs forpancreatic cancer (p for trend, 0.41), lung cancer (p for trend, 0.19) or bladdercancer (p for trend, 0.25).

Drinking two or more cups of coffee perday was associated with a crude RR for colon cancer of 2.0 (95% CI, 1. 1-3.6) for menand 1.5 (0.8-2.6) for women. Different multivariate analyses were completed for thefirst 10 and the last II years of follow-up siiice the association between coffeedrinking and colorectal cancer varied across this period. The excess risk associatedwith drinking two or more cups of coffee per day in the latter follow-up period was3.0 (p ~ 0.05) for men following adjustment for age, egg consumption, excess weightand meat consumption. The equivalent ad justed risk for women was 2.4 (p c: 0.05).(The Working Group noted that the distribution of coffee drinking in thispopulation is unusual because there are few heavy coffee drinkers: 17-18% of thepopulation drank two or more cups per day. There may be residual confounding byother factors associated with non-adherence to dietary restrictions.)Two papers have been published from a prospective study conducted inNorway examining the relationship between coffee drinking and cancer incidenceand mortality among approximately 16 000 men and women (Heuch et aL., 1983;Jacobsen et al., 1986). Site-specific incidence and mortality were determined amongthree groups of people: a probability sample of adult males selected from the 1960census, Norwegian brothers of migrants ta the USA, and spouses and siblings ofpeople interviewed for a case-control study of gastrointestinaI cancer. Averagedaily coffee consumption was determined by questionnaire in 1967-69. No data arepresented on the completeness of the II.5-year follow-up, during which time therewere 602 cancer deaths and 1498 incident cancers (incIuding 207 nonmelanomatousskin cancers). Incidence data that were presented for approximately 20 cancer siteswere adjusted for sex, age and residence; sorne additional analyses among maleswere also adjusted for smoking. ln the calculation of RRs, comparisons were madebetween the consumption of two or fewer and seven or more cups per day. The RRfor mortality from cancers at ail sites was 1.3 (p for trend = 0.09). Raised RRs werereported for the incidence of cervical (10.6; p for trend = 0.07) and lung cancer (1.8;p for trend = 0.02); the smoking-adjusted RR for lung cancer incidence amongmales was 1.1 (p for trend = 0.84). Heavy coffee drinking was associated withreduced risks for the incidence of colon (RR, 0.6; p for trend = 0.10) and kidneycancer (RR, 0.3; p for trend = 0.01). The RR for the incidence of pancreatic cancerwas 0.7 (p for trend = 0.37) and that for bladder cancerwas 0.99 (p for trend = 0.99).(The Working Group noted that odds ratios were in fact calculated and presentedas RRs.)A cohort study investigated a six-year follow-up of pancreatic cancer incidenceamong 122894 men and women who had completed a questionnaire collecting dataon coffee, tea, smoking and alcohol use in 1978-84 (Riatt et al., 1988). There were 49cases of pancreatic cancer. A multivariate analysis (ad justing for age, sex, ethnicity,',\n",
       " \"118IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51blood glucose level, smoking, alcohol and diabetes) identified no increased riskassociated with increasing coffee consumption.A co hart study (Mils et al., 1988) of approximately 34 00 non-Hispanic, whiteCalifornian Seventh-day Adventists followed participants for six years after theircompletion of a questionnaire determining their exposures in 1976. Fort y deathsfrom pancreatic cancerwere reported. ln the analyses of age- and sex-adjusted RRsfor pancreatic cancer, current consumption of coffee at least once a day relative tano consumption was associated with a RR of 2.0 (95% Ci, 0.9-4.4). Pastconsumption showed an inconsistent, nonsignificant protective relationship withmortality from pancreatic cancer. Multivariate analyses, using the Coxproportional hazards model, give a RR for current coffee consumption, adjustedfor age, sex and smoking of 2.2 (95% Ci, 0.6-8.0).A cohort study of colorectal cancer incidence in a retirement community (Wuet aL., 1987) identified 58 male and 68 female cases among 11888 people in a 4.5-yearfollow up. Questionnaires were completed between 1981 and 1982 by 62% ofcommunity members. ln an analysis that adjusted only for age, there was no effectof increased coffee intake on cancer risk in women and a nonsignificant increase inmen.Paffenbarger et aL. (1978) examined the association between coffee drinkingand mortality from six cancers in a nested case-control analysis of a cohort study inthe USA of 5000 male former college students (the same population as used byWhittemore et al., 1983, p. 116). Each case was matched with four contraIs chosenrandomly from among classmates born in the same year and known ta havesurvived the decedent. Information on risk factors was obtained from medicalrecords completed at the time of college entry. Coffee drinking at that time wasassociated with a two- to three-fold higher risk for Hodgkin's disease, lymphaticand myeloid leukaemia, but no significant association was found withnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with malignant melanoma orwith other and unspecifiedleukaemias.(c) Case-control studies(i) Bladder and urinary tractBladder cancer. More than two dozen case-control studies have beenpublished on the association between coffee and bladder cancer.

The study, in which 90% ofcases and controls participated, found a RR of 1.2 for men and 2.6 for womenamong coffee drinkers versus non-coffee drinkers, after adjustment for age andsmoking at three levels (non-smokers, ~1/2 pack, :: 1/2 pack per day). The RR wassignificant for women, and was 1.6 for one, 3.8 for two to three and 2.2 for four ormore cups per day. The association was apparently stronger among the 90 caseswho neither smoked nor had a high-risk ocupation.ln a study conducted in Louisiana, USA, Dunham et al. (1968) obtainedinformation on 493 patients with bladder cancer and 527 controls admitted tohospital for a wide spectrum of other conditions. The data were stratified for typeof coffee, sex and race, and reanalysed by Fraumeni et al. (1971), in a study reportedas a letter to the Editor of The Lancet. Sorne association was found for blacks(significant in females) but not for whites. After adjustment for age and smoking,the overall RR was 1.5 (nonsignificant). There was no consistent dose-responserelationship.ln a Canadian case-control study of 158 men and 74 women with bladdercancer and similar numbers of controls with benign prostatic hypertrophy (men) orstress incontinence (women), data were collected using a postal questionnaire onprevious health, employment, beverage and artificial sweetener intake (Morgan &J ain, 1974). The overall response rate was 69% among the cases and 57% among thecontrols, but the numbers of subjects included in the final analysis were furtherreduced by matching for age. The mean number of cups of coffee drunk per daywas1.8 for cases and 2.0 for controls among females, and 2.1 for both cases and controlsamong males. The RR (calculated by the Working Group) for coffee drinkers versusnon-drinkers was (0.7) for males and (1.3) for females. None ofthese estimates, northe corresponding trends in risk with dose was significant.A study by Simon et al. (1975) was based on 216 white female cases of cancer ofthe lower urinary tract (renal pelvis, ureter, bladder (95% ofcases) and urethra)identified at 10 hospitals in urban areas in Massachussets, USA. Among them, 40had died and 41 did not respond. The remaining 135 cases were compared with 390respondent controls out of a total of 648 selected from the discharge lists of the samehospitals. Postal questionnaires were used for data collection. Ninety-threepercent of cases drank coffee versus 85% of the controls, with an unadjusted RR of2.1 (95% Ci, 1.1-4.3). The unadjusted RRs were 2.2 for one or two cups per day, 1.9for three to four and 2.3 for five or more. (Adjustment for smoking by the WorkingGroup was possible according to two categories only (nonsmokers and lightsmokers versus moderate to heavy smokers); the RR declined ta (1.9) and was nolonger significant.)Wynder and Goldsmith (1977) utilized data collected between 1969 and 1974on patients interviewed in 17 hospitals in six areas of the USA (46% from Memorial',\n",

The refusaI ornonparticipation rate was less than 4%. The RRs for whether coffee was ever drunkor not, adjusted for smoking at four levels, were above unit y (RR, 1.5 for males, 1.3for females). Trends in risk with dose were not significant.Miler et aL. (1978) published data from a study originally planned ta considerthe possible association between isonicotinic acid hydrazide, a drug used in thetreatment and prophylaxis of tuberculosis, and bladder cancer. Patients admittedto a hospital in Ottawa for bladder cancer (255 cases) and other urologicalconditions (510 contraIs) completed a questionnaire including, among other items,information on coffee and tea consumption. ln relation ta coffee, a matched,unadjusted analysis provided a RR of 1.3 for males and of 1.6 for females. (TheWorking Group noted that no information was provided on the confounding ormodifying effect of covariates, including smoking.)Mettlin and Graham (1979) studied the role of dietary factors in the risk forbladder cancer using data from the Roswell Park Memorial Institute, NY, USA,collected between 1957 and 1965 (Bross & Tidings, 1973). A total of 429 white maleand 140 white female patients with primary bladder cancer were compared with1025 contraIs admitted for non-neoplastic conditions. After adjustment forsmoking in two categories (less th an half a pack versus half a pack or more per day),the RR for five subsequent levels of coffee drinking was around unit y in women, butabove unity in men, in the absence, however, of any trend in risk (RRs, 1 (referent),1.4, 1.2, 2.1 and 1.6). Consequently, in the two sexes combined, there was a small,inconsistent increase in smoking-adjusted RRs for bladdeT cancer risk withincreasing coffee consumption: 1 (referent), (1.2, 1.1, 1.8 and 1.3).Howe et al. (1980) reconsidered the relation between coffee and bladder cancerin a Canadian population-based case-control study of 480 male and 152 femalecase-control pairs (Miller, 1977). The overall response rate was 77% for the casesand 86% for the contrais. For users versus non-users of any coffee preparation, theRR was 1.4 for men and 1.0 for women, neither estimate being significant. Theunadjusted RRs were 1.5 (95% Ci, 1.0-2.2) for men consuming brewed coffee and1.5 (1.1-2.0) for those drinking instant coffee, and 1.4 (0.8-2.6) for women consuminginstant coffee, but no dose-response relationship was found.Cartwright et al. (1981) conducted a case-control study of bladder cancer inWest Yorkshire, UK, a high incidence area for the disease. The study populationincluded 841 cases (631 male, 210 female; 622 prevalent, 219 incident) and 1060hospital patients of similar age and same sex. ln this preliminary report, noinformation was given on participation rate. Questions were asked on coffeedrinking habits and various types of coffee, besides other known and potentialbladder cancer risk factors (smoking, saccharin use, occupational history, past',\n",
       " '124IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51medical history). No relation was found between any type of coffee consumptionand bladder cancer risk after adjustment for smoking. The RRs for drinking aIltypes of coffee, adjusted for age, type of case (incident/prevalent) and cigarettesmoking, were 1.1 for males and 0.8 for females (corresponding estimates notadjusted for smoking were 1.3 and 1.1, respectively). Similarly, no heterogeneity inrisk was observed between instant and ground coffee. The authors conc1uded thatthe correlation between cigarette and coffee consumption can explain the moderateassociation observed in the unadjusted analysis.Morrison et al. (1982) published data from a population-based case-controlstudy from Boston, MA, USA (587 cases, 528 contraIs), Manchester, UK (541 cases,725 controls) and Nagoya, Japan (289 cases, 586 controls). A further report of asection of this study was made by Oh no et al. (1985). Con troIs were selected fromelectoral rolls or other population registries. Participation rates in various centreswere over 80% for both cases and contraIs. The overall RR for coffee drinkersversus non-drinkers, adjusted for age, sex, centre and smoking was 1.0 (95% CI,0.8-1.2), and in no ne of the centres was there consistent evidence of a dose-responserelationship.Najem et aL. (1982) considered several risk factors for bladder carcinogenesisin a case-control study in New Jersey, USA, of 75 histologically confirmed casesamong white people and 142 matched contraIs derived from the same c1inic andhospital populations from which bladder cancer cases were obtained. Only fivecases and 16 controls did not consume coffee. The RR (not adjusted) was 1.8, with avery wide 95% CI (0.1-10.0). (The Working Group noted the small number of casesand the limited information provided.)Sullivan (1982) analysed 82 bladder cancer cases (out of 101 diagnosed) and169 controls selected through random digit diallng in the area of greater NewOrleans, LA, USA. ln relation to coffee drinking, a number of inconsistentrelationships was observed. White male cases, for instance, reported significantlygreater consumption of brewed ground coffee th an controls, and white womenconsumed more decaffeinated ground coffee than controls. No relationship wasfound with duration of use. (The Working Group noted that no RR was given, andthere was no indication that adjustment was made for covariates.)The largest case-control study on bladder cancer was that published by Hartgeet al. (1983), based on 2982 cases and 5782 general population con troIs interviewedin a collaborative, population-based study conducted in ten geographical are as ofthe USA. A report of part of this study was made by Marrett et aL. (1983).Participation was 73% for the cases and 82% for the controls. The RRs for everversus never coffee drinking were 1.6 (95% Ci, 1.2-2.2) for men, 1.2 (0.8-1.7) forwomen and 1.4 (1.1-1.8) for men and women combined, after simultaneousallowance for sex (when appropriate), age, race, geographical are a and tobacco',\n",

When various levels of coffee consumption were considered, the RRwas significantly above unity (1.5; 1.1-1.9) only for men drinking over 63 cups ofcoffee per week, but no dose-response relationship was evident for either men orwomen. Similarly, there was no association with duration of coffee drinking. Nointeraction was observed with geographical area, race, occupation, artificialsweetener use or history of urinary infections. The authors noted that adjustmentfor smoking reduced the RR for ever/never coffee drinking from 1.8 to 1.4, and thatresidual confounding by tobacco (or possibly other correlates of coffee drinking)may explain the persistent but inconsistent relation between bladder cancer andcoffee. Men who drank only decaffeinated coffee (ground or instant) had anestimated RR of 1.2 (0.8-1.9) compared to men who never drank coffee. Thecorresponding estimate for women was 1.5 (0.9-2.6). Kantor et aL. (1988), examiningthe same data set by three separate histological types (squamous-cell, adeno- andtransitional-cell carcinomas), found a significant trend in risk for adenocarcinomasin men and women combined, although the number was extremely low (32 cases)and none ofthe point estirnates was significant. (The Working Group noted that thelack of significance may be the result of less precise adjustment for.smoking th an inthe study by Hartge et al. (1983).)ln a population-based study carried out using the Connecticut (USA) TumorRegistry during 1978-79, Marrett et al. (1983) investigated the relationship betweencoffee consumption and bladder cancer. Data were available on 412 cases aged21-84 (80% of those identified) and 493 con troIs (81% of those selected). Afteradjustment for age and smoking, the RR for one cup per week or more was 1.3 formales and 1.1 for females; for more th an seven cups per week the RR was 1.5 formales and (1.0) for females. ln males, there was sorne evidence of a dose-responserelationship: for over 21 cups per week, the RR was 2.0. No trend in risk with dosewas evident in females, nor with duration in people of either sex. The authors notedthat among male and female nonsmokers combined, the RR for more than sevencups per week was 1.9 (95% Ci, 1.0-3.6). There was no significant effect of theconsumption of decaffeinated coffee. (The Working Group noted that there may besome overlap between this study and that of Hartge et al. (1983).)ln a case-control study in Aarhus, Denmark, Mommsen et al. (1983a,b)collected information from cases admitted to hospital and (through maIledquestionnaires) from population controls (response rate of first selected controls,85%). The overall report, based on 165 male and 47 female cases, found noassociation with coffee drinking, but an elevated risk was observed (RR, 2.6) amongwomen, although the estimate was not significant and only one case and fivecontrols were not coffee drinkers.

The refusal rate was only approximately 1%. The RR,adjusted for smoking, was not elevated in drnkers of one cup per day comparedwith non-coffee usrs; however, a signficant RR of 1.7was found when drinkers oftwo or more cups were conípared with those drinking fewer than two cups per day.For male and female cases combined, the point estimates for five levels of coffeeconsumption were 1 (referent), 1.2, 1.7, 2.7 and 0.7, and the trend in risk wassignificant (p = 0.02).Gonzáles et al.

The RRs were1 (referent), 1.4, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.8 for subsequent levels of coffee use. The pointestimates tended to be above unity for female coffee drinkers, but they were notdose- related.Claude et al.

A total of431 cases (34 male, 91 female) were matched for age and sex with 431 controls, whowere primarily patients in hospitas for urological diseases (79%) and in homes forthe elderly (21%). Only about 2% of cases refused to paricipate. The results werepresented for each sex separately after allowance for smoking (never/ever andlifetime consumption in packs). ln peple of each sex, the RRs were above unity forcoffee drinkers; the point estimates for more than four cups per day were 2.3 inmales and 2.2 in femaIes, and the trend in risk was signficant for males. The RRsassociated with coffee drnking were similar in smokers and nonsmokers. ln thisstudy, a positive association was found with tota daily fluid intake, with aparicularly high RR in males.

The participation rate was over 98%.Compared with non- or moderate coffee drinkers, the RRs adjusted for age, sex,area of residence, social c1ass and smoking were 2.0 for intermediate and 1.6 forheavy drinkers; the trend was not significant.Rena pelvis and ureter. The etiology and pathogenesis of transitional-cellcancer of the renal pelvis and ureter are in several aspects similar ta those ofbladder cancer, although the frequency of cancer at these sites is much lower and,hence, the studies are based on small data sets.One study in the USA (Schmauz & Cole, 1974), based on 43 cases of cancer ofthe renal pelvis and ureter and 451 population control s, showed a positiveassociation with high levels of coffee consumption among men (RR for over sevencups per day, 14.9; 95% CI, 2.4-94.3).',\n",

Indeed, there was a significant excess of cases who had neverconsumed coffee regularly.A population-based case-control study of 74 cases and 697 controls in the USA(McLaughlin et al., 1983) showed no consistent association between cancer of therenal pelvis and coffee drinking in people of either sex after adjustment for smoking(RR, 1.6 for men, 0.5 for women).The largest study on cancer at this site (187 case-control pairs) was conductedin Los Angeles County, USA, using telephone interviews for cases andneighbourhood controls (Ross et al., 1989). Heavy coffee drinkers had anapparently elevated risk for cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter (RR for seven cupsor more per day, adjusted for cigarette smoking, 1.8), but the trend in risk with dosewas not significant.Kiney The causes of renal-cell cancer (adenocarcinoma of the kidney) areless weIl defined but are certainly, at least in part, different from those of cancer ofthe urinar tract.ln a case-control study conducted in several areas of the USA between 1965and 1973 on 202 patients with adenocarcinoma of the kidney and 394 hospitalcontrols, Wyder et al.

No significant association wasobserved in men.A study from Australia (McCredie et al., 1988) based on 360 cases of cancer ofthe renal parenchyma and 985 population controls found no association with coffeeconsumption, but no precise information is given in the text.(ii) PancreasTwenty-one case-control studies have reported on the relationship betweencoffee consumption and pancreatic cancer; these data are summarized in Table 34on p. 140.As part of a study of cancer at 13 sites, Lin and Kessler (1981) reported on 109histologically confirmed cases (67 male, 42 female) of pancreatic cancer (94adenocarcinomas and 15 islet-cell tumours) identified in 1972-75 in more th an 115hospitals in the USA. Equal numbers of hospital controls were matched for age,sex, race, hospital and year of admission. Most of the cases and contraIs wereintervewed while in hospital by a persan who was unaware of the diagnosis of thepatient. Overall 86% of eligible subjects were interviewed. It was reported in aletter that an association was found with drinking decaffeinated coffee but not withtotal coffee consumption: 91% of the cases drank coffee compared ta 93% ofcontrols, but 41% of cases drank decaffeinated coffee compared to only 25% ofcontrols (p ~ 0.01) (Kessler, 1981).MacMahon et al. (1981a,b; the latter studywas reported in a letter) reported on367 histologically confirmed cases (216 male, 151 female) of pancreatic cancer(excluding islet-cell tumours) out of 578 patients under 80 years of age identified inIl hospitals in Boston and Rhode Island, USA. There were 643 hospital controls,out of 1118 eligible patients, who had been at hospital at the same time as the cases;254 had diseases other th an cancer at sites other than the gastrointestinal tract, 157had cancers other th an in the gastrointestinal tract, 117 had diseases of thegastrointestinal tract other th an cancer, and 115 had gastrointestinal cancer. Eachcase and control pair was interviewed personally by the same physician. The mainreasons for failure to participate were death (20 cases, 9 contraIs), early discharge(35, 131), ilness (78, 179), language difficulties (14, 26) and refusaI (26, 73). Anincreased risk was found for bath men and women. The RR of coffee drinkersversus non-coffee drinkers was 2.6 for men and 2.3 for women. No dose-responsewas observed in men, but a significant trend with consumption was found inwomen, rising to a risk of 3.1 for women who drank five or more cups per day.

Thestudy of Jick and Dinan (1981), published as a letter, which gave few details, wasbased on 83 cases and 161 hospital controls aged c: 80 years in several countriesmatched 2:1 for age, sex, hospital and year of admission and used a standardpersonal hospital interview. Elinder et al. (1981) conducted two studies: ln one, theyused information from certificates of deaths in 1961-74 in two small Swedishparishes; the study was based on 21 male cases and 51 deceased male controlsobtained from a random sample of deaths in the same parish and matched for age.Next-of-kin, usually wives, were interviewed. The second study was based on 41twn pairs, bom 1886-1925, both of whom were alive in 1961 and one of whomdeveloped pancreatic cancer. Information was obtained from postalquestionnaires. The study of Goldstein (1982) was based on 91 histologicallyverified cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed in 1973-80 in San Diego, CA, USA;controls were patients with cancer of the prostate (45) and breast (48). Routinehospital interview data were used. Severson et al. (1982) based their study on 22cases aged 40-79 from a registiy that was part of the SEER (Surveilance,Epidemiology and End Results) Program in Seattle, WA, USA, 1977-80, and on arandom population sample of controls. Next-of-kin were interviewed for most ofthe cases (20), whereas personal interviews were obtained for controls. The last twostudies were also published as letters, which contained few details.A large study of 275 histologically verified cases (153 men, 122 women) aged20-80 interviewed in 1977-81 and of 7994 hospital contraIs also gave negative results,with risk ratios veiy near to unity after adjustment for smoking (Wynder et al., 1983).This was part of a large study of tobacco-related cancers in six US cities; controlswere patients with non-tobacco-related diseases: 42% had other cancers, 10% hadbenign neoplasms and 7% had trauma. Personal interviews were carried out withinsix months of diagnosis. During the last year of interviewing, 45% of potential casesand 35% of potential controls completed interviews. The main reasons for Hotinterviewing cases were death, early discharge, ilness and persan al or physicianrefusaI. The main reason for not interviewing controls was that their initialdiagnosis had ben made more than six months before interview.KInlen and McPherson (1984) re-evaluated data from the case-control study ofStocks (partIy reported by Stocks, 1957) on data collected in north-west Englandand north Wales in 1952-54 on 216 cases (109 men, 107 women) aged ~ 40 years.These were compared with 432 controls, who were patients with other cancers in theoriginal study, matched 2: 1 for age, sex and area of residence; cancers of the lung,bladder, mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, gastrointestinal tract and ovary wereexcluded, and controls were thus patients with breast cancer (38%), prostaticcancer (19%), leukaemia or lymphoma (19%), renal cancer (7%) and other cancers',\n",

Seventy-two patients refused to be interviewed,physician consent was not obtained for 36, and 10 patients could not be traced orhad died and no relative could be found. Of the 201, 25% had a personal intervew;for 35% the spouse was interviewed and for 40%, another relative. Two controlgroups were used: a matched hospital series (for age, race, sex, hospital, date ofadmission) in which patients with other cancers were exc1uded (30% had heart orother circulatory disease and 13% had digestive disease) and a population-basedgroup that was chosen by random-digit diallng, matched by age, race, sex andtelephone exchange and interviewed by telephone. Participation was about 50% of'eligible' individuals in both control series; a total of 20 706 telephone numbers and37033 calls were made to find eligible controls. A nonsignificant relationship wasfound among women only, but this was less apparent when smoking was adjustedfor.Mack et aL. (1986) conducted a study of 490 histologically confirmed cases (282male, 208 female) of adenocarcinoma of the exocrine pancreas in patients aged-c 65 years, comprising all those registered in Los Angeles county, and an equalnumber of neighbourhood controls matched for age, sex, race and neighbourhoodin Los Angeles, CA, USA. Home interviews were conducted;for cases, about 25%of the intervews were with the case, 53% with the spouse and 19% withafirst-degree relative. Cases were selected from 736 eligible cases; losses were due tafailure to lòcate the case (77), physician refusaI (43), patient refusaI (86), languageproblems (10) and failure to find a matched control (17). Final medical revieweliminated another 13 cases. Results for coffee drinking showed a significantrelationship, which persisted after adjustment for smoking.Norell et al.

Cases were 241 women discharged with a diagnosis ofbreast cancer. Three controls were matched to each case for age, smoking habit,study and country. Coffee and tea drinking were grouped as 'hot beverageconsumption'. Compared to those who did not drink coffee or tea, RRs for thosewho drank one to three, four to six and seven or more cups per day were 1.3, 1.5 and1.1 (90% CI, 0.6-1.8 for the last category), respectively.Lubin et al. (1981) reported the results of a study conducted in northernAlberta, Canada, during 1976-77. Interview was completed for 577 cases and 826population controls. The response rate was 95% for cases and 72% for controls.Information on consumption of tea or coffee was obtained along with demographic,reproductive and medical histories and data on several food items. Tea and coffeeconsumption was analysed together: the age-adjusted RR whencomparing morethan five cups per day to five or fewer was 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9-1.5).Mansel et al. (1982) in an abstract reported the results froID an analysis of acomputer data base of 20 00 hospital in-patients with a diagnosis ofbreast disease.These patients were compared with a matched non-breast disease group. Ascompared with non-coffee drinkers, coffee drinkers had an increased risk for breastcancer (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.99-1.6). (It was not clear who was included in the control\",\n",

Although information wascollected on several doses levels, information on any dose-effect relation was notavailable.lLubin et al. (1984, 1985) conducted a hospital-based case-control study inIsraeL. Cases were histologically confirmed breast cancer cases in the greater TelAviv metropolitan area diagnosed between 1975 and 1979. Two control series,surgical and neighbourhood, were used; each was matched individually ta a case byage (:1 five years), country of origin and length of residence in IsraeL.Neighbourhood con troIs were drawn from the national voting list and lived in thesame voting district as the cases. Information was sought on the frequency ofconsumption of 250 food and beverage items as well as on selected hormonal,medical and demographic characteristIcs. Response rates among the eligiblesubjects were 96% for cases and surgical contraIs and 72% for neighbourhoodcontrols. A total of 818 cases, 743 surgical controls and 813 neighbourhood contraIswere included in the analysis. Breast cancer cases were found to consume lesscoffee than both control series.Rosenberg et al. (1984, 1985) analysed data obtained in a case-controlprogramme for the surveilance of drug effects. Cases were 2651 in-patients inhospitals located in eastern USA who were interviewed between 1975 and 1982.There were two control groups: one consisted of 1501 women admitted for acutenonmalignant conditions (trauma or infections); the other comprised 385 womenwith malignancies (malignant melanoma, lymphoma and leukaemia). With eithercontrol group, RRs were close ta 1.0 and there was no trend of increasing risk withincreasing daily intake of coffee. Coffee drinking was not associated with breastcancer risk among subgroups ofwomen stratified by age and reproductive history,history of fibrocystic breast disease, family history of breast cancer, or body massindex. Among a subset of subjects who did not drink caffeine-containing coffee,age-adjusted RRs were close ta 1.0.ln a study in France, described by Lê et al. (1984) and reported in a letter by Lê(1985),500 cases and 945 surgical con troIs with nonmalignant disease were studied.The risk for breast cancer was found to be inversely associated with reportedcurrent daily coffee consumption. Results were similar for women with and withouta history of benign breast disease.La Vecchia et al. (1986) conducted a hospital-based case-control study ofbreast cancer in Italy, beginning in 1980. There were 616 pairs of cases and controls.Adjusted RRs for coffee drinking were 1.0 for none, 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1-2.4) for lessthan two, 1.4 (1.0-2.0) for two to three and 1.1 (0.7-1.7) for four or more cups per day.There was no tendency for the risk of breast cancer to increase with increasingquantity or duration of coffee drinking.',\n",

The study included 12 cases from twoteaching hospita in the Greater Athens area and 12 controls admitted foraccidents and orthopaedic disorders in a third teaching hospita. Subjects wereasked to indicate average frequency of consumption of 12 foo or beverage itemsin the period precding the onset of disease, along with information ondemographic, soioenomic, reproductive and medical variables. A test for alinear trend was not signficat for coffee consumption.Schairer et al. (1987) conducted a cas-cntrol study on paricipants in theBreast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project in the USA, a five-year screeningprogramme begun in 197. Cases were diagnosed from June 1977 to November1980. Control subjects were women who had not ben recmmended for, and hadnot undergone, sUfgica evaluation during screening parcipation and were similarto breast cancer cas with regard to screening centre, age, ethnic origin, time ofentry into the screening programe and length of participation in the programme.The number of daily servngs of brewed, instant or decafeinated coffee was notassociated with increased risk for breast cancer.Pozner et al. (1986) exained caffeine and coffee intake in women with breastcancer to determine whether it infuences cell differentiation in tumours. Dietaryhistory was obtained by intervew with 106 women who had undergone mastectomyand axllary dissection for breast cancer at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in NewYork, USA. Information on tumour differentiation was missing for five women,leaving 101 with complete data. Thmours categorized as weil or moderatelydifferentiated were grouped (70 subjects) and compared to poorly differentiatedtumours (31 subjects). Women with moderately to well differentiated tumours hadhad a higher intake of coffee (2.65 :: 2.23 cups per day) than women with poorlydifferentiated tumours (1. 71:: 1.43); the same trend was seen for caffeine and for allcoffee, decaffeinated coffee, cola and tea. Stepwise logistic regression, with tumourdifferentiation as the dependent variable and coffee, both cafeinated anddecaffeinated, tea, cola, coa, cafeine (mg/day), cafeine (mg per kg boy weightper day), vitamn A, age and Quetelets index as candidate independent variables,indicated that high coffee consumption is associated with moderately and welldifferentiated tumours; afer accunting for differences in coffee intake, no othervariable in the model emerged as significant. When logistic regression wasperformed including smoking, oral-cntraceptive use, parity, number of children,age at first pregnancy, age at menarche, total calories, protein, total fat and othernutrients, however, no variable appeared to be significantly associated with degreeof tumour differentiation. (Te Working Group noted that this study is diffcult togroup with other studies of etiology. Also, factors that historically have been linkedto breast cancer did not appear to infuence tumour differentiation in this study.)',\n",

(1981) reported data from a relatively small case-controlstudy in Athens, Greece, showing a suggestive positive association between coffeeconsumption and risk of ovarian cancer of corn mon epithelial types. Theassociation was significant (two-tailed p ~ 0.03) when dose trends (cups of coffeeper day, lifetime consumption of cups of coffee) were taken into account. (TheWorking Group noted that this study is not considered separately, since the relevantdata are part of a larger subsequent study (Trichopoulos et al., 1984; Tzonou et al.,1984).)Subsequently, Hartge et al. (1982) reported in a letter to the Editor of TheInterntiona Journ of Cancer data on coffee and ovarian cancer collected as partof a case-control study of ovarian cancer (McGowan et al., 1979). Cases were 158women with pathologically confirmed primaiy ovarian cancer of the epithelial tyetreated in participating hospitals in the Washington DC area. Con troIs were 187women frequency-matched to cases for age, race and hospital, treated at the samehospitals for conditions other than gynaecological, psychiatric or malignantdiseases or pregnancy. Ten women had been excluded from the control seriesbeause they were hospitalized for conditions that might necessitate alterations inthe diet. Women who regularly drank any amount of coffee had a nonsignificantincreased risk for ovarian cancer compared to non-coffee drinkers (adjusted RR,1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.2), but there was.no statistically significant dose-response. (The',\n",
       " \"150IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51Working Group noted that there was no apparent confounding by the controlledvariables in this study. The crude estimate of RR for drinkers of any amount ofcoffee was (1.3), Le., identical to the reported adjusted figure.)ln a multicentre, hospital-based case-control study, Miler et al. (1984, 1987)collected data on 290 women, 20-69 years old, with epithelial ovarian cancerdiagnosed within six months of the index hospital admission. Two control groupswere used: women with benign conditions hospitalized more or less acutely (580)and women with malignancies (476) presumed to be unrelated to coffee (thusexcluding women with pancreatic or bladder cancer) and to other factors that areconsidered to be predictive of ovarian cancer (thus excluding women withendometrial cancer). Women with benign conditions were a priri considered to beheavier consumers of coffee than the other control group (Miler et al., 1984). Therewas no evidence of a positive association between ovarian cancer and drinkingdecaffeinated coffee. With respect to brewed coffee, there was evidence of apositive association with overall consumption when comparison was made withnoncancer controls, but there was no such evidence when ovarian cancer cases werecompared with the 'other cancers' control groupe ln no instance was there a clearindication of a dose-dependent trend. (The Working Group noted that, since theresults with respect to the two control groups are contrary to what was predicted, itis legitimate to combine the two control groups, the results of which are given inTable 36. The crude estimate of RR for drinkers of any amount of coffee was (1.2);from the crude and adjusted data, there seems to be no evidence of confounding.)Byers et al. (1983) conducted a case-control study of dietary and nondietaryfactors in ovarian cancer. Cases were 274 white women, 30-79 years old, admitted tothe Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA, between 1957-65 forovarian cancer. Nineteen addition al cases with ovarian tumours of nonepithelialorigin and 36 additional cases with ovarian cancer diagnosed more than two yearsprior to the admission date were excluded. Controls were 1034 women, 30-79 yearsold (probably white only) admitted during the same period to the Institute forconditions that were found to be nonmalignant. An additional 499 women withdiagnoses related to the reproductive system and 408 with conditions of thegastrointestinal system (401) or diabetes (seven) were excluded. There was nostatistically significant association with any consumption category or dose trendwith respet to coffee consumption. (The Working Group calculated that theage-adjusted RR for drinkers of any amount of coffee, with adjustment ta agedistribution of the control group by the direct method, was (1.2) (nonsignificant).)ln the Greek case-control study (Tzonou et al., 1984), coffee consumption wascompared between 150 women with epithelial ovarian cancer admitted to any of tenlarge hospitals in Athens between 1980 and 1981, and 250 control womenhospitalized during the same period for fractures or orthopaedic disorders in the\",\n",

(The Working Group noted that the crudeestimate of RR for drinkers of any amount of coffee was 1.2; comparison of crudeand adjusted RR estimates indicates that there was little confounding, and thatwhich existed was slightly 'negative'.)Cramer et al. (1984) conducted a case-control study in the Boston, MA (USA),area between 1978 and 1981. Cases were 215 white women with newly diagnosedepithelial ovarian cancer admitted to 12 participating hospitals, whereas con troIswere 215 white women randomly select~d from lists of Massachusetts residents,matched for age and precinct of residence. There was no evidence of an associationbetween ovarian cancer and any of the combinations of coffee drinking, alcoholdrinking or tobacco smoking. The crude RR was 1.2 for coffee drinkers. ln thecombinations that included coffee drinking, the RRs of coffee users versus nonusersof either coffee, alcohol or tobacco were between 1.2 and 1.8. (The Working Groupnoted that there was no evidence of overt confounding with respect to the results forcoffee.)La Vecchia et al. (1984) conducted a case-control study of ovarian cancer inMilan between 1979 and 1983. Cases were 247 women, 19-74 years of age, withepithelial ovarian cancer admitted to the university hospital and the NationalCancer Institute of Milan. Con troIs were 494 women below the age of 75 yearsadmitted to the university or general hospitals of the Milan area, suffering fromdiseases judged to be unrelated to coffee consumption or to any of the establishedor suspected risk factors of ovarian cancer. ln the logistic regression analyses, therewere statistically significant linear trends with daily consumption of coffee (p =0.(03) and with years of regular coffee consumption (p = 0.02). (The WorkingGroup noted that comparison of cru de (1.4) and adjusted RR indicates that there issome degree of confounding that incorrectly reduces the association between coffeeconsumption and risk of ovarian cancer ('negative' confounding).)ln a case-control study in the San Francisco Bay are a, CA, USA, between 1983and 1985, Whittemore et al. (1988) compared the exposure histories of 188 womenwith primary epithelial ovarian cancer admitted to one of seven participatinghospitals with the exposure histories of women in two control groups. The firstcontrol group consisted of women hospitalized in one of the hospitals to which caseswere admitted, whereas the second group was selected from the general populationusing random-digit diallng. When both control groups were combined, there was astatistically significant positive association between coffee drinking and the risk forovarian cancer.

RRswere elevated in 23 of the 24 categories of coffee drinking by quantity (cups per day),duration (years) or by product when hospital and population controls wereconsidered separately; they were significantly elevated (p ~ 0.05) in II out of 12such categories when hospital and population controls were combined. However,no clear trend was seen with daily quantity of coffee consumed.Overall, in all seven case-cntrol studies of coffee use and risk for ovariancancer, users of any amount of coffee had an increased risk, although the elevationwas significant in only two. ln most of the studies, the increase was small orminimal: the overall crude RR estimates were between 1.1 and 1.3 in five studies, 1.4in a recent study and 1.9 in the last one. Use of crude estimates is legitimate, sinceconfounding of the association between coffee drinking and ovarian cancer in thesesets was either absent or negative. ln only one study was there a statisticallysignificant dose-response relationship.

Coffee drinking was associated with a RR of 0.7, which wasnot statistically significant.A significant negative association between coffee consumption and coloncancer was reported from case-control studies in Norway and the USA (B jelke,1973).Graham et al. (1978) carried out a case-control study of white male patientswith histologically confirmed cancer of the colon (256 patients) or rectum (330patients) and 1222 controls seen at the Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo,NY, USA, during 1959-65. Con troIs were non-cancer, non-gastrointestinal patientswho were selected so as to have a similar distribution as the cases, but no individualmatching was carried out. Patients attending the hospital where the study wascarred out were similar to the population of the neighouring areas iu terms ofsocioenomic and marital status, religion and smoking habits. The intervewincluded demographic, socioeconomic and dietary variables. Frequent drinking ofcoffee was associated with a 'significant but small excess risk' for cancer of the colonbut not of the rectum, as was 'drinking coffee very hot'. (The Working Group notedthat no figures were given, that, other th an for age, there was no adjustment forpossible confounding variables and that no RRs or Cls are given.)Dales et al. (1979) carried out a study of black patients with colorectal cancerand matched con troIs from hospitals and c1inics in the San Francisco Bay are a, CA,USA. Cases were identified from a cancer registry covering the period September1973 to August 1976, but 60% could not be interviewed, mostly due ta death orsevere illness, leaving 99 cases. Similarly, only 50% (280) of the con troIs who wereidentified were successfully interviewed. The questionnaire was answered at thepatients' homes and inc1uded demographic and socioeconomic data, as well asinformation on dietary habits three years prior to the interview. No associationbetween coffee drinking and colorectal cancer was found. (The Working Groupnoted that the low rates of participation make this study difficult to interpret andthat RRs associated with coffee consumption are not given.)Watanabe et al. (1984) studied 65 cases of cancer of the rectum (39 male, 26female) and 138 cases of colon cancer (71 male, 67 female) in Kyoto, J apan. For eachcase, one control was selected; the sex and age distribution of cases and con troIswere similar. Data were collected on a number of dietary items inc1uding coffee andtea consumption. No significant association was found between coffee drinkingand cancer of the rectum or of the colon, although both risks were reduced by2030% among coffee drinkers.1àjima and Tominaga (1985) compared the characteristics of 42 incident casesof colon cancer (27 male, 15 female) and 51 cases of rectal cancer (25 male, 26female) with those of 186 controls admitted to a specialized hospital in Nagoya,Japan, between 1981 and 1983.

There was no significant association between coffee drinking andeither colon or rectal cancer (RRs for daily drinkers, 1.1 and 1.0, respectively). (TheWorking Group noted that almost half of the controls had gastrointestinalconditions.)Macquart-Moulin et al. (1986) reported a case-control study from Marseile,France, based on 399 histologically confirmed cases of colorectal cancer and thesame number of controls which was conducted between 1979 and 1984. Afteradjustment for age, sex, calories and weight, the risk in increasing quartiles of coffeeconsumption was 1.0, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.6. The test for trend was not significant.Tuyns (1986) and Tuyns et al. (1988) presented the results of a study whichcovered approximately one-half of the cases of colorectal cancer in two Belgianprovinces, Oost-Vlaanderen and Liège, in 1978-82. A total of 453 cases of coloncancer, 365 of rectal cancer and 2851 population controls were included. Theresponse rate for controls was approximately 70%. The analyses were adjusted forage, sex and residence. 'Heavy consumers' of coffee and/or tea had crude RRs of 0.7(95% CI, 0.6-0.9) for colon cancer and 0.8 for rectal cancer (0.6-0.9), relative ta 'lightconsumers' (Tuyns, 1986). Separate results are not given for coffee and tea drinking,but the latter was reported to be rare.ln Yugoslavia, Jarebinski et al. (1989) compared 98 patients (56 male, 42female) with histologically confirmed rectal cancer admitted to one of five hospitalsin Belgrade in 1984-86 to two control groups: Hospital contrais were patientsadmitted due to non-cancer conditions - mainly fractures and other injuries,cardiovascular diseases and hernias; a second control group consisted ofneighbours of the cases. Controls were matched to cases by age, sex, place ofresidence and interviewer. The RRs associated with any coffee consumption were1.7 when compared with hospital controls and 0.8 when compared withneighbourhood controls. The corresponding RRs for consumption of three or morecups per day were 1.1 and 0.8, and for having consumed coffee for 30 or more years,1.2 and 1.2. None of these differences approached statistical significance. (TheWorking Group noted that no data are given on the proportions of potential casesor controls who could not be contacted.)La Vecchia et al. (1988, 1989c) studied 455 histologically confirmed cases ofcolon cancer (221 male, 234 female), 295 cases of rectal cancer (170 male, 125female) and 1944 hospital controls recruited from a network of teaching and generalhospitals in greater Milan, Italy, between 1985 and 1988. Controls did not includepatients with malignant tumours, digestive diseases or any condition related to useof coffee, alcohol or tobacco or which may have resulted in long-term dietarymodification. RRs were calculated through logistic regression after adjustment forsex, age, social class, education, marital status, smoking and alcohol consumption.Compared to subjects consuming no to one cup per day, those consuming two cups\",\n",

The corresponding figures for rectal cancerwere 1.0 and 0.7 (p for trend, ~ 0.05). The RRs were also examined afterstratification for sex, age, marital status, education, social class, smoking andalcohol consumption. The overall pattern of protection afforded by coffee againstcolon cancer was evident in all strata but appeared to be restricted to males.ln another case-control study, carried out among Singapore Chinese, Lee et al.(1989) studied 203 (121 male, 82 female) consecutive incident cases (132 cases ofcolon cancer, 71 of rectal cancer) admitted to a general hospital in 1985-87. Alicases had histologically confirmed colorectal cancer. A total of 426 contraIs wereselected among 489 patients who were free of any gastrointestinal disease, cancer ordiabetes; approximately two con troIs were selected for each case, matched for agegroup and sex. The response rates for cases and controls were above 80%. Coffeeintake of one or more cups per day was associated with a nonsignificant 30-40%reduction in the risk for cancer at each site. When both sites were poole d, theassociation was close ta significance (O. 1 ~ p ~ 0.05). The effect of coffee remainedvirtually unchanged after adjustment for other food items for which a significantresult was found. However, there was no evidence of a dose-response relationship.Data on coffee consumption was collected as part of a multicentre, multiorgancase-control study in the USA (Rosenberg et aL., 1989). ln 1978-82, data wereobtained on coffee consumption one month before interview, whereas during1983-86 the data on consumption were for one and three years before hospitaladmission. Cases were 717 patients with cancer of colon and 538 with rectal cancer,aged 30-69 years. A non-cancer control group consisted of 2128 trauma and 369appendicitis patients, and a second, cancer control group was composed of 892patients with malignant melanoma and 494 with lymphoma and bone cancer.Multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusting for age, sex, geographic area, year ofinterview, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, education, religion and race,were employed, using persans who consumed one cup of coffee per day as thereferent category. For colon cancer, the adjusted RRs for drinking less th an one,two and three lo four cups of coffee per day compared to one cup per day were allclose to one, but the risk associated with drinking five or more cups per day wassignificantly reduced (0.6; 95% Ci, 0.4-0.8). This risk pattern was similar for menand women and when recent or past consumption was evaluated. For rectal cancer,the risks were close ta unity for present or past consumption at all dose levels. Therisk pattern was somewhat different for males and females: with the exception of asignificantlyelevated risk for drinking three to four cups per day (1.7; 95% CI,1.0-2.8), men had nonsignificantly increased risks for all other dose categories;however, women had nonsignificantly reduced risks.',\n",

For each case, four age-and sex-matched control patients were selected: two non-cancer patients from thesame ward and two orthopaedic controls from a general hospital. Neither in theunadjusted analysis nor after adjustment for dialect group was there an associationbetween coffee drinking and oesophageal cancer. Reported drinking of 'burninghot' coffee, however, was associated with a five- ta six-fold higher crude risk ofcancer. (The Working Group noted that the control groups inc1uded a large numberof patients with digestive disorders.)Yen et al.

From the main registry included in the study, 41% ofthe cases could not be interviewed. Controls were selected froID inpatient andoutpatient facilities and were matched to the cases for age, sex, race andsocioeconomic status. No association was found between coffee drinking andnasopharyngeal carcinoma. (The Working Group noted that the description of the',\n",
       " \"166IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51selection of cases and controls is confusing, as several different sources were used,and that a high proportion of cases could not be interviewed.)Mabuchi et aL. (1985b) studied 149 patients with histologically confirmedcarcinoma of the vulva from five metropolitan areas in the USA between 1972 and1975. Cases were identified from more than 115 hospitals. One non-cancer patientwas matched to each case according to age, race, marital status and hospitaL.Drinking one or more cups of coffee dailywas associated with a doubling ofthe RRfor cancer of the vulva, but this was not significant. The risk was significantlyhigher, however, among women drinking three or more cups per day. There was nodose-response relationship.Mettlin (1989) reported a case-control study of 569 cases of histologicallydiagnosed lung cancer and the same number of controls who had no diagnosis orhistory of malignant or benign neoplasms, selected from patients seen at RoswellPark Memorial Institute in Buffalo, NY, USA. After adjustment for sex, smokinghistory, beta-carotene intake and education level relative to the risk in people whohad never drunk coffee (1.0), the risk in increasing categories of coffee consumptionwas 1.0 (0.7-1.5) for less than one cup per day, 1.0 (0.7-1.4) for two ta three cups perday and 1.3 (0.9- 1.8) for four or more cups per day. The study also presented dataregarding intake of decaffeinated coffee, and for the same categories ofconsumption the RRs were 1.0, 0.7 (0.5-0.9), 0.5 (0.3-0.7) and 0.8 (0.5-1.3).ln a case-control study of 208 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 401hospital controls in northeastern Italy, Franceschi et al. (1989) found a direct trendin risk, of borderline statistical significance, for coffee drinking in a multivariateanalysis (RR for the upper tertile, 1.6). Only total methylxanthine-containingbeverage consumption was correlated in multivariate analysis, which seemed toflatten out the relationship moderately.Table 40.Summary of results of case-control studies on other cancers andcofTee consumptionReference,SubjectsCoffeeRelativeCommentsloction(cass, con troIs) consumptionriskand site(cups/day)Hendersn et al.Men and women01.0Nonsignificant;(1976)(156, 267)Any1.1adjusted for sex, race,USAsocioeconomic status,Naspharyplace of residencePaffenbarger et al.Cas-cntrol analysis(1978)of cohort studyUSAdescribed on p. 118Hodgkn's diseasMen01.0Nonsignificant; .(45, 180)Any2,5matched analysis\",\n",

Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation4.1 Exposure dataCoffee is a beverage that has been consumed in many parts of the world forcenturies. The two main types of cultivated coffee are arabica and robusta. Greencoffee is one of the major commodities of world trade and is exported mainly fromtropical countries. Ground roasted coffee is brewed in many different ways,including decoction/boilng, infusion, filtration and percolation. Instant (soluble)coffee and decaffeinated coffee are more recent developments. Instant coffee is thedried pure water extract of ground roasted coffee and Is used directly to prepare thebeverage. Caffeine, the major pharmacologically active purine present in coffee,can be effectively and selectively removed from green coffee beans ta give,ultimately, decaffeinated coffee.\",\n",
       " '168IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51Worldwide consumption of roasted coffee was estimated ta be 4.3 miliontonnes per year in 1983-87. Per-caput consumption in Nordic countries is two orthree times higher th an that in Canada, the USA and other countries of Europe.These regions have higher consumption levels than in the rest of the world.Over 700 volatile compounds in many structural categories have beenidentified in roasted coffee, as well as numerous nonvolatile components (e.g.,polysaccharides, melanoidins, protein-like products, chlorogenic acids). Arabicaand robusta green coffees contain average caffeine levels of 1.2% and 2.2%,respectively, on a dry weight basis. Depending on the brewing method and speciesof coffee used, caffeine levels in the beverage are generally in the range of 70-150 mgper cup. Many volatile aldehydes and ketones have been characterized in coffee,inchiding glyoxal and methylglyoxaL. Occasional contamination of green coffe eswith mycotoxins has been reported.4.2 Experimental carcinogenicity dataCoffee was tested for carcinogenicity in one study in mi ce and in two studies inrats by oral administration. The mice received instant coffee in the diet for theirlifetime, including the gestation period; no increase in tumour incidence wasreported. Rats were given brewed coffee as the drinking fluid in one study; a slightincrease in the number of tumour-bearing animaIs was seen only among males inthe lowest dose group. ln another study, rats were given different samples of instantcoffee, decaffeinated coffee or decaffeinated coffee supplemented with caffeine; noincrease in tumour incidence was observed.These three studies are suggestive of an absence of relationship between coffeeand cancer in experimental animaIs, but the incomplete reporting of the study inmice precludes a definitive evaluation at present.ln a number of studies, various known carcinogens were administered bydifferent routes either simultaneously or sequentially with coffee in water as thedrinking fluid or in the diet. Several of these studies, however, suffered from variouslimitations and were not considered for the evaluation.ln one of the adequate studies, coffee reduced the number of pancreatictumours per animal in azaserine-treated rats maintained on a high-fat diet; theresult may have been due in part ta impaired growth. No significant effect of coffeewas found on the number of pancreatic tumours per animal induced in hamsters byN-nitrosobis(2-oxypropyl)amine. ln separate experiments, rats on two differentdiets were treated intravenously or orally with a single dose of 7,12-di-methylbenz(a)anthracene in combination with coffee. No difference in the numberof rats with mammary tumours was found as compared to animaIs receiving7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene only; a significant decrease in the number of',\n",

There was no consistentassociation between coffee intake, usually estimated indirectly from trade data, andcancer risk, although significant results were occasionally reported in a number ofstudies. Pancreatic cancer was correlated with coffee consumption in all of thestudies in which the relationship was examined. None of the ecologicalstudiesshowed an association with risk for bladder cancer.(h) Analytical studies(i) AlI sitesA cohort study in which a case-control analysis was used showed anonsignificant reduction in risk for mortality from cancer at aIl sites with increasedcoffee consumption. A second cohort study with longer follow-up reported anonsignificant increase in mortality after adjustment for age, smoking and otherconfounders.(ii) Bladder and urinary tract cancerTwo cohort studies reported findings on bladder cancer incidence. ln one,there was a nonsignificant increase in risk; the second showed neither an increasenor a decrease.Of the 26 case-control studies considered that provided information on thepossible relationship between coffee drinking and the occurrence of urinary tractcancers, predominantly of the bladder, in very different populations, 22 were usedto make the evaluation. ln 16 studies, a weak positive association was seen withconsumption of coffee as compared ta nonconsumption; in seven of these theassociation was significant, with a dose-response relationship in three. Noassociation was seen in the six remaining studies. The association persiste d, butwas less clear, when reported nonsmokers were considered in seven of the 16studies, suggesting that confounding by tobacco smoking is unlikely ta be the soleexplanation for this finding. The association was also found in men and womenseparately, suggesting that occupational factors could not fully explain the finding.Of the four available case-control studies, three indicated a slightly increasedrisk for transitional-cell cancers of the renal pelvis and ureter, but none of the',\n",
       " \"170lARe MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51results was significant. Six case-cntrol studies and one cohort study do notprovide evidence of a consistent association between adenocarcInoma of the kidneyand coffee drinking.Although drinking of decaffeinated coffee was addressed in six case-cntrolstudies, it was not possible to distinguish the effects from those of coffee containingcaffeine.Taken as a whole, these data are consistent with a weak positive relationshipbetween coffee consumption and the ocurrence of bladder cancer, but thepossibility that this is due to bias or confounding cannot be excluded.(ii) Breast cancerNone of the seven case-cntrol studies has suggested the existence of anassociation between breast cancer risk and the consumption of coffee. AlI of thestudies gave relative risk estimates that were near unity. One study presentedresults on instant coffee separately and also found no association; three studiesshowed no association with decaffeinated coffee consumption. Confounding due torecognized risk factors for breast cancer was controlled in most studies. There is noreason to believe that measurement error or confounding was responsible for thefinding.(iv) Cancer of the large bowelCohort studies that addressed the issue of coffee drinking and risk for cancerof the colon or rectum were not particularly informative but have generally beeninterpreted as showing no association.Of the 12 informative case-cntrol studies, Il indicated inverse ('protective')associations between coffee consumption and risk for colorectal cancer, whichreached significance in five. A significant dose-response relationship was seen inone study. At present, it is not possible to exclude bias and confounding as thesource of the apparent inverse association, but the collective evidence is alsocompatible with a 'protective' effect.(v) Pancreatic cancerSix cohort studies provide data on the relationship between coffeeconsumption and pancreatic cancer. None reported a significant association withincreased consumption; any nonsignificant increase was reduced followingadjustment for smoking.Twenty-one case-cntrol studies have reported on the relationship betweencoffee consumption and pancreatic cancer. An early report showed a positiverelationship, with a significant dose-response, in women but not in men, whichpersisted after removing those controls with digestive disorders. Another study\",\n",
       " 'COFFE171reported a significant relationship with decaffeinated coffee but not withconsumption of all kinds of coffee. Nineteen subsequent reports have been lesspositive overall. ln ten of these studies, a positive association was seen; in three ofthese, the findings were significant, with a dose-response relationship in twostudies. No association was seen in seven studies, and a weakly negative associationwas found in another. A nonsignificant increase in risk for the highest exposuregroup has ben a more consistent finding, but this has generally becme weakerafer adjustment for smoking and may be the result of residual confounding.Potential biases associated with the comparabilty of case and control groups alsocomplicate interpretation, and methodological problems were noted in somestudies.Taken as a whole, the data are suggestive of a weak relationship between highlevels of coffee consumption and the ocurrence of pancreatic cancer, but thepossibilty that this is due to bias or confounding is tenable.The results with regard to decaffeinated coffee are less comprehensive buthave generally been negative.(vi) Ovarin cancerln two case-cntrol studies of coffee drinking and risk for ovarian cancer, asignificant increase in risk was found, whereas in five others smalI, nonsignificantincreases were noted. An overall analysis of the data indicates a marginal,significant increase in relative risk, but bias from unidentitìed sources or evenchance cannot be ruled out.The few available studies do not suggest that drinking decaffeinated coffeeincreases the risk for ovarian cancer.(vii) Gastric cancerThe relationship between coffee drinking and gastric cancer was studied in fivecase-cntrol investigations, none of which showed an association.(viii) Cancers of the upper digestive tractSix case-cntrol studies assessed the association between coffee drinking andcancers of the oesophagus, mouth and pharynx. After ad justment for confoundingvariables, the frequency of coffee drinkingwas not associated with risk for cancer inany of these studies. Overall, no association was found between coffee drinking andcancers of the upper digestive tract, except when populations who drink coffee atvery high temperatures were studied.',\n",
       " \"172IARC MONOGRAHS VOLUME 51(ix) Cancers ut other sitesln one case-cntrol study, no association with the ocurrence of liver cancerwas found among coffee drinkers after adjustment for smoking and alcoholconsumption.Two cohort studies and one case-cntrol study showed no association withlung cancer.A cohort study reported associations between coffee drinking and Hodgkin'sdisease and lymphatic and myeloid leukaemia; no association was reported with theocurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, malignant melanoma, or other andunspecified leukaemias. One case-cntrol study showed an increased incidence ofcarcinoma of the vulva among coffee drinkers. A single cohort study showed anassociation with cervcal cancer.4.4 Other relevant data(a) Toxic effectsThe available evidence cannot be used to establish a significant, independentrelationship between coffee consumption and morbidity or mortality from coronaryheart disease. The question remains open, however, especially in view of the findingthat some methods of coffee preparation are associated with an elevation in plasmalevels of cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins.(h) Effects on reproduction and prenatal toxicityThe teratogenic potential of coffee and caffeine-cntaining beverages wasinvestigated in two cohort and four case-control studies. Two studies (one cohortand one case-control) found significant positive associations between theconsumption of caffeine-cntaining drinks and the risk for malformations. Theremaining four studies (one cohort and three case-control), which included thethree most informative reports, failed to find an association. Taken together, thesestudies do not provide evidence of a teratogenic effect of coffee intake.Eight studies, from Costa Rica, the Federal Republic of Germany, the UK andthe USA, reported an association between decreased birth weight and intake ofcoffee and caffeine-containing beverages, which was statistically significant in thecrude analyses. After correction for confounding variables, including smoking,four of the studies reported positive associations which were significant. Of twoother studies, one reported an increased risk among heavy consumers which,however, was not significant, and the other reported a positive association of onlyborderline significance. The two remaining studies did not show an associationafter adjustment for confounding.
